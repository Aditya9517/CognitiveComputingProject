It's fun. Violet, our lovable dowager, is her quip usual self, & thank goodness. A few new characters have entered on scene that are delightful, and hopefully will return for the next movie.To be a set designer & purchaser for this film must have been a fabulous treat! Oh, my. If you like antiques, this is the movie for you. Also, the lighting in several scenes were simply extensions of the moment. They were just perfect. Be prepared to be pleasantly entertained and enthralled by it all."

      "review": "I sat down to watch Downton Abbey trying to think if there as ever been a good movie made of a successful tv series. Can't say that any movie sprung to mind.Having seen Downton Abbey got to say that this will be another movie that doesn't quite live up to the tv series in my opinion. The running time is 2 hours, so a number of the movie plots are very rushed in comparison to the time they are given in a tv series. It seems that if a character didn't fit into the overall plot of the royal visit to Downton then they had their own sub plot. The movie isn't terrible and the characters are very much the same as they were in the tv series. Can't say I was a fan of the lighting of the movie unless the cinema was having problems with projection.If you were a fan of the tv series you'll find the movie very watchable, but if you didn't watch the tv series you should probably avoid the movie."

      "title": " Great High Quality Television Drama ! Magnified ?",
      "review": "I'm a keen fan of Downtown Abbey as a Television Drama so I find it difficult to rate or critique Downton as a Cinema release. Why? you may ask. I enjoyed the movie to a point because Ive also enjoyed the 52 episodes of the 6 series on television . However I don't really think it makes a great movie transfer although it's entertaining and enjoyable. It has all the high quality wit and sumptuous surroundings of the original TV series and creator Julian Fellowes is a master of portraying the Upstairs/Downstairs world of the Aristocracy and the snobbery from both sides of the divide.No spoilers from me other than anybody who saw the trailer knows the entire movie centres around a Royal visit to Downton Abbey from King George V and Queen Mary. All the usual performances are as good as in the Television production but I really enjoyed the addition of Geraldine James as Queen Mary and Imelda Staunton as Lady Bagshaw cousin to the Dowager Countess Violet Crawley played beautifully as usual by Maggie Smith .Anyone who enjoyed the Downton Abbey series will surely enjoy making acquaintance with all their favourite characters again but I'm not sure the big Cinema screen didn't make them seem more like soapy cardboard cut outs at times. PS. As Mathew Goode heads the cast list on IMBd I expected to see more of him than just a walk on at the end, most disappointed as I think he would have made Lady Mary Crawley played by Michelle Dockery happier and less austere and irritating."

How he is able to have a parade of characters varying in depth and degree while making them all interesting to watch is an achievement few can have. The. We have the cast who bring the words to life and breath nuance into them and they all perform tremendously in their return to these well eastablished characters. My only issue are small story elements that feel a bit shoehorned to provide a little action. But other than that, I love this historically fictional world we have been graced with and can't wait to see if they will decide to continue ur this story and if not then a humble ending to a beautiful story."

When the movie was announced, I thought it would just be another money grab. Usually the story is poor and the acting is phoned in. Quite the opposite was true. The story was decent and the actors did a great job. They maintained the personalities of the series. If you did not watch the series you would probably find the movie less enjoyable, but that is true for any sequel. As was mentioned by others, the gay segment was unnecessary and totally out of context in the movie. It did not spoil the movie, but it certainly added nothing and it never occurred in the series. The rest of the characters stayed true to the series."

We gladly joined them, and savored the balm-like effect of the not-too-loud, familiar Downton Abbey theme, whose bittersweet, contemplative qualities we'd almost forgotten. We all knew were re-entering our communal time machine back to the Edwardian era, and the modern world of Donald Dump and Boris Brexit could lick our English-wanna-be , at least for about three and a half binge episodes of Downton Abbey.We did not care that the plot was a mish-mash of mildly upsetting occurrences except for one assassination attempt on the ultimate rich twit, the King of Albert Edward Land, which was also treated as a mildly upsetting occurrence. We did not object when the back stairs staff of D.A. kidnapped, drugged, and defrauded their counterparts on the Royal staff without consequence, because after all, this is our Edwardian dream, and we don't get caught or consequences here. We sat in rapt silence while Violet Crawley, Dowager Countess of Grantham, called Lady Mary Talbot into a private room to tell her three things: That her own character was about to be killed off, that she, lady Mary, was doomed to leading the Hindenburgenian decline of Downton Abbey for the rest of her life, and finally, that Maggie Smith would be dead before any more D.A. content could be produced, so just sit there and like it.It's a lackluster movie, but we're going again tonight in full costume."

The charm and wit of a time almost gone acts for a solid foundation and will pull everyone into the movie as you relive the magic. Great acting, wonderful human, and most importantly the balance of humor and drama makes this movie a worthy addition to the legacy of the regal series. Sure, the pace is not quite as good given limitations to one showing, some of the characters are not as strong as they once were, and it was a little busy in the run time. Despite this though, I recommend the film be enjoyed by all fans in the theater, while others will be wanting to hold off until home viewing.My Scores are:Drama: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.5"

The story line was great, the cast was great (as always), and done with original style and splendor of the TV series. We loved it!Our only disappointment was pushing the Hollywood gay agenda on us once again. We have nothing against these good folks, but, it does not have to be in every movie or show on TV... folks do get tired of it, thus the reason for not giving it 10 stars.However, overall, we enjoyed the move and being able to see all of our Downton cast members again."

Then the huge part that ruined the whole movie - a lingering sequence of Barrow in gay scenes that plagued the entire movie. It was focused on WAY too much, was highly unrealistic, and served NO purpose to enhance the movie. Too much graphic homosexual scenes. I binge watched the whole series in preparation of this movie and had been sooooo excited and even made a girls night out to the movies. We were all disappointed."

Everything was perfect right up until they started giving Thomas Barrow such a big part. His story line was twice as big as all of the others. Ya we get that he's gay, but so what hollywood. I would have given it 10 stars, but I'm just so sick of them shoving the homosexual way of life down our throats all the time. Right down to Stephen King's new movie opening scene. It wasn't in the book but they sure did make sure to have a 5 minute opening about gay lovers. I don't go to movies to see straight people making out, what makes you think everyone ones to see gay people making out in EVERY new movie coming out of hollywood."

Even Lady Edith looked pretty good this time, plus her period-era one-piece undergarment showed some cleavage and inferred a little sexuality - being that she was finally married to a decent chap and even in the early stages of yet another pregnancy. Whew, that was long-winded.I enjoyed seeing the old cast. I was disappointed that Barrow was no longer the conniving scoundrel that he had been in the TV series. I was happy that O'Brien was not in the film, but perhaps she, too, may have become sugary sweet. Ugh.The family started out poor, for aristos, since they had to be bailed out by Shirley MacLaine's family money at the beginning. Toward the end of this film, they are still trying to put their heads together to think of ways to keep the property financially afloat.Irony: Highclere Castle, the estate in real life, today has events and tours in order to keep the property financially afloat. Renting it out to make the TV series and this film is just one of its money-making ventures. Gotta pay the light bill, you know. Pip, pip. Cheerio.King George V and Queen Mary of Teck were the paternal grandparents, in real life, of the current Queen Elizabeth II of England. They were the parents of King George VI, Elizabeth's father. They were also the parents of King Edward VII, Elizabeth's uncle, the famous abdicator."

The characters were so flushed out during the series like the Avengers in their solo movies.This movie is almost perfect! This is the final episode that we should've received at the end of the series.With so many characters and more royal characters added for the movie, I was afraid things would feel cramped. They tied the movie together in a good way. They also left it open so I'm completely okay with receiving a new Downton Abbey movie every 3 or 4 years.The humor is there. The family drama is there. Everything is there. I only have two minor complaints.1: Jim Carter; I love Carson. He's my favorite. Out of all the characters, I felt that Carter was the only one that didn't fall back into his role. Since he is my favorite, I could've just been overly critical of him. He's still great but the royal cast really muddled things and made some of the characters not have a purpose.2: Maggie Smith; We all love Maggie. I laughed at all of her funny parts. It did seem that the writers relied on her to carry quite a few scenes in the movie. I feel like a few of her scenes weren't needed.Should this have been in the theater? Probably not but it was nice enjoying it with a bunch of other Downton fans. You should absolutely see this movie in theaters."

The ladies' clothing is gorgeous, and downstairs, the staff connives to put those snooty baggages of the Palace household in their places. Team Downton triumphs. There are glimmers of future happiness for everyone, and a set-up for a believable sequel, if that ever happens (please yes!). Ten years on, this will be so interesting. It runs a bit superficial and predictable, and fans will long for the series format so we can wallow in all those silly, daily dramas of a bygone world.

It was like being in my livingroom on a Sunday evening, only with a much larger screen. My idea of a wonderful way to spend a couple of hours. The core characters haven't changed, the sets haven't, the introduction of new characters. It transports me to an era that I don't think exists very much anymore, unless you're part of or involved somehow with the British Royal Family. Maggie Smith was, again, ready for one of her tart remarks that made me chuckle. Well, now that the Crawley family and their devoted servants have survived a royal vist from King George V and Queen Mary, I say bring us more! I can see at least two more films from this. How does the Crawley family survive the Great Depression and the Second World War."

It will make you warm and fuzzy inside (maybe with the odd tear of joy!), and let you escape from the madness of today's world. My only slight gripe, was I'd love to have seen Spratt and Denker in it, but as not one scene was set in the Dowagers house, it would have been difficult to include them, but maybe they could have been arguing in the village shop or something, I did miss them! Do see it on the big screen if you can, the cinematography is expansive. Cannot recommend highly enough."

This movie has the exact same feel and pacing as the TV series.

Maybe there should be a new Downton movie every three years or so like Star Wars.My only criticism is the images looked better on my HDTV than on the big screen. Sharper and clearer but that's a minor thing.Final thought: great date movie."

She's easily the worst character and she's given way too much screen time. I literally hate her.The stupid servant uprising is both weird and kind of daft. You would think that these royal toffs coming in to take over for a few days might give these downton servants a nice reprieve. I would be like yay you can clean the silver thanks, but no they don't want anyone else to polish their floors. Lame!The secret daughter subplot was way too predictable, they should've made the servant her secret lesbian lover, that would've made it more interesting.Does anyone else wish Marys insipid husband would just die?Overall though still fun, fans of the show will enjoy."

      "review": "What can I say about the TV series Downton Abbey? While I can't say a lot about the plot and characters, as I haven't seen the show, it has made a big impact, even here in America where it ran for six seasons (or series as the British say) on PBS. I know it has to do with a wealthy aristocratic family and the lives of them and the servants. Judging by the house, of course it would need to be run like it's own business. Im sure a lot of people came for it's story, but I think the major draw was the sets, costumes, and the feeling that your watching something classier then your typical cop show or reality show.Having only seen two episodes, I see Downton Abbey as a high budgeted soap opera. There's nothing wrong with that as soap operas do keep the focus of the plot on the family, thus the need to write compeling charecters in order to make it work. It just so happens that because of the 1920s timeframe, Downton Abby gets to also throw in a lot of historical context in relation to the wealthy family. So let's see what the Downton Abbey movie brings to the screen.In 1927, the head of the family, Robert Crawley (played by Hugh Bonneville) has received a letter that King George and Queen Mary will be visiting and staying at Downton Abbey as a part of the royal tour. He informs the rest of the family including his wife Cora (played by Elizabeth McGovern), daughter Lady Mary Talbot (played by Michelle Dockery), her husband Tom Branson (played by Allen Leech) and his mother Violet (played by Maggie Smith) who all have different reactions. Some are excited and some are ready to confront other family regarding inheritance and just who is who.Meanwhile, the staff, as lead by butler Thomas Barrow (played by Robert James-Collier), is thrilled that the royal family will be visiting the estate. However, the family feels that he won't be up to the responsibility, so they ask former butler Mr. Carson (played by Jim Carter) to temporary return to manage things. Though the staff feels ready, their dismayed to not only find out that the royal family will be brining their own staff, but those at Downton Abbey are told to stay out of the way. Will the staff be able to prove themselves?For someone who hasn't seen the show, what did I think of Downton Abbey? The story itself seems fine. I admire a movie for having a simple goal; to simply see that a royal visit goes according to plan. Now the use of a large cast is another thing. With the countless family members, staff members, and now with Buckingham Palace, that is a lot to juggle. Some of the side stories are easy to grasp and others clearly have more background thanks to the long running show. So the question is whether this was better as a show. I'd say so, but it isn't without it's merits.The set design and costumes are really impressive, even if they are leftovers from the show. I can understand how a large audience can get sucked into this world. Some of me wishes I could be a part of this world, even though I know I could never high class enough. All the actors feel like their in the right place, but again, that probably has to do with the fact they've already done this for seven seasons.Unlike a lot of movies based on TV shows that are adaptations, this is a continuation of a larger story. Would have I have gotten into it had I'd seen it? Probably. There were some parts I had sympathy for, such as the staff not wanting someone else to do their jobs. But whenever it cut to the aristocratic family, I feel like I'm steeping into an argument that started a while ago. Because of that, inclined to believe that the movie was made for the fans and not newcomers. It's not a way for someone unfamiliar to be introduced. It's something to satisfy someone whose had plenty of Downton Abbey and wants more.I'll give this six Downton Abbey houses out of ten. Overall, I'm not sure if this was for me, but I can see a lot of people enjoying it anyhow. I'd say watch some of the show first to know what your getting into. Heck, it might be better if you see the entire series. So check out the show first before you check into the movie."

This means it doesn't leave time for any deep or dramatic plot twists, just little somewhat predictable and familiar scenarios for each character to resolve throughout the film. This made it feel a little cheesy at times, and left me wanting one of those really heart wrenching or beautifully triumphant moments that Downton Abbey does so well, but we don't see that in this film. BUT I think it's better this way though, because if they were to have enough time to develop one of these, we would feel disappointed on not really getting that update on other characters we care about too. So this is light hearted, easy to watch and gives us that Downton Abbey fix we all need. I hope they will consider beginning a new series in the future to continue the story!"

It wasn't so much that it didn't have oomph, it was more that I thought the characters, particularly the downstairs ones, were acting out of character. I can't say more without a spoiler alert, but it was disconcerting. I would have so much rather got caught up with all of their lives, and the ins and outs of that. I was happy for Thomas however! I do hope there will be several more Downton Abbey movies, and I will happily go to them, but if you're expecting--as I was--that since it was fabulous on TV it will be even better at the movies, well that's not the case."

When Isobel interrupted them my heart broke a little thinking \"OMG, she's going to be devastated.\"My only negatives are 1) too many aerial/drone shots of the castle (felt like an ad for a Viking tour!) 2) no solid info on the status of Molesly & Baxter's relationship 3) Molesly was funny but almost felt over-acted, almost cheezy 4) the children were pointless - more like additional scenery than actual characters.That said, it was lovely to escape modern-world stressors & step into Julian Fellowes' 1920's for a couple hours."

      "review": "For the dramedy Downton Abbey, set in 1920's Yorkshire, let me settle the question most often asked: Do you need to have seen the wildly popular TV show of the same name and origin to enjoy the film? No. It stands alone as an entertaining visit to an estate that contains the changes coming in a robustly interesting time between world wars.The Crawleys and their relatives own Downton while the servants run it. The conflicts between the upstairs and downstairs are few, and the respect is rampant. The underclass is blissfully devoted to the aristocrats, while the blue bloods subtly realize how much they need the blue collars. The concurrent subplots pile up in a bewildering number, to the extent you might long for a commercial break to take a breath.Especially as the visit from the royals is imminent. King George V (Simon Jones) and Queen Mary (Geraldine James) will descend for one night bringing their staff with them. Of the many struggles featured in this jam-packed character drama, the workers must stifle their humiliation that they will not be serving the royals; a parallel group of intruder commoners, who travel with the royals, will replace Mr. Carson, Mrs. Patmore, and Mrs. Hughes, and the rest of the domestics. How the Downton staff manages to serve the royals anyway forms a delightful pageant of deceit and tomfoolery, lightly emphasizing their playfulness and the lack thereof in the aristocrats.Like the countless rooms in the abbey, the intrigues are many, but to the credit of director Michael Engler (he knows complicating circumstances from directing Sex and the City), each one is clearly etched and each character amply defined (at least for the large size of the cast). Fans of the TV series will delight in seeing once again the dowager countess Violet (Maggie Smith) deliver her usual barbed comments to anyone who will listen.When a minor relative, Tom Branson (Allen Leech), becomes involved with a maid, Lucy (Tuppence Middleton), to a royal lady-in-waiting, Maud Bagshaw (Imelda Staunton), the connection is complicated but genuine, actually breathing honesty while it waits for an ingenious circumstance to make the romance right.Change is in the air as the footman-become-butler, Thomas Barrow (Robert James-Collier), is revealed to be gay, experiencing the wrath that England had for such unworthy targets years ago as Oscar Wilde. However, the film suggests Britain is slowly on its way to justice just as the working class is on its way to equality.Yet as the film so rightly shows, the aristocrats will try to hold out in the face of the winds of change. Happily for us, as we enjoy the waning days of monarchy and a bit of anarchy-a fine mix for entertainment and modernism, both to become major cultural players in the latter half of that century right to our own new century. Although inequality exists, it has a very short life to go."

The characters, the relationships, the majesty, the heart, the laughs (Maggie Smith is laugh-out-loud funny), the house, the music, the beauty of it all - it's all here. There's no way I wasn't going to love it.But, as much as I loved Downton Abbey, it's not perfect. First, Julian Fellowes and Company tried to do too much. There's not enough time for all of the little plot threads the movie contains. To cram in everything they tried to, it would have needed to be filmed as seventh season - not a two hour movie. Second, I cannot imagine going into this movie without having seen the series. It's not so much a movie as it is a gift to the fans. Downton Abbey isn't really much of a standalone movie.As I've said repeatedly, for me, it's all about entertainment. And I was completely entertained throughout.9/10"

This movie doesn't break any new territory or propel the characters off in new directions. Instead, it only provides a snap shot of the life for the Crawley family and their staff two years after the events at the end of the tv series. And it was brilliant.When this movie was first announced, I was sceptical. Of course, the first thought to cross my mind was \"money grab\". But also unplanned, and unexpected, continuation of stories that have tied up their loose ends, tend to end in a flop. I worried that, in order to make this a good stand alone movie, the writers would have to create conflict, meaning they would have to break down the happy endings. Fortunately, what they produced instead what felt like a two hour epilogue meaning all the characterisation remains intact. Yes, from a critical standpoint, this means the movie lacks any real depth but I don't think it needs too. We had all the character depth and growth from the tv show. Instead this film is light hearted romp with all my favourite characters living their happy endings and showing off how much they have changed ( I am looking at you Barrow.) It also wraps up a couple of loose ends that remained which was also great to see. It is the movie I wanted it to be.This movie has all the charm and happiness of the tv show; like visiting an old friend you haven't seen in years.

It feels that the side characters were there only to have Smith talk to someone and the villain was generic to the point of yawning.Technological advancements were lost on me, since I couldn't see this movie in my theatre as it was intended. I was left with underwhelming action that looked quite fake and \"rubbery\" at times and I was honestly amazed how uncanny valley it was at certain points.Despite some good actors, a talented director and couple of visually striking shots, \"Gemini man\" was a joyless experience that tries to be deep, but feels empty. It's not ridiculous enough to be fun and it's not smart enough to be appreciated on another level.If you want a generic action movies with couple of fun stuff thrown in there, I guess this is servicable enough, but for me - this is a definite skip."

Fearing that he's losing his edge he decide's to retire as the Defence Intelligence Agency's ace wetwork man. But discovering that the man he killed wasn't a terrorist sets Smith off on a dangrous path which will lead to his associates being murdered. When normal hitmen can't do the job he faces the ultimate opponent- his younger self.Some amazing chase scenes especially on motorbikes the younger Smith uses the bike as a weapon, has to be seen. Also the battles along rooftops, in water, even in the catacombs under Budapest. The fight ranges across the world from the US to Colombia to Hungary and back to the US again. Gemini doesn't just stand for Smith's clone, it is also a private security firm run by Smith;s former CO in the Marines. A company used when deniability is essential as well as proving contractors on the ground to supplement US troops. We deep in conspiracy territory in the world of Black Ops and the smoke and mirrors of the intelligence community.The new special effects are ok, it looks like a young Smith but they could have used his son or a ringer with prosthetics. Director Ang Lee delivers an entertaining SF/Conspiracy Action Thriller. 8/10."

A couple scenes sets in the movie reminded me of Game of Thrones. In particular the scene when Henry and Junior were in area with the skulls on the wall. At the end of the movie I read David Benioff listed as the Screenplay Writer. There has been plenty of reviews saying that the CGI is bad. It was okay for me. I saw the movie at a MJR Digital Cinema.

      "title": " Reasonable action movie but not groundbreaking (one generic spoiler later in review)",
      "review": "Overall, this movie is pretty good. I saw the movie in 2D so my comments about the CGI are based on that version. I see no specific reason to see it in 3D based on my viewing despite the casts' claims but I wouldn't say it'd be an entire waste either. One thing I find is missing in a lot of reviews is the reviewer's own personal scale. So, here's mine.I would rate this movie based on Will Smith's performance as significantly better than After Earth but a little below A Pursuit of Happyness or Seven Pounds. The CGI, with the exception of one explosion, was good. Somewhere between Avatar and say something like GI Joe: Rise of Cobra but closer to Avatar. Clive Owen was passable as the villain although he was arguably the worst character in the movie of the main cast. I preferred his work in Inside Man for example. Most of the secondary characters didn't have a lot to work with in terms of screen-time or character development but the movie is pretty much four characters (Will Smith, Will Smith, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Clive Owen) so it doesn't detract from the movie.In terms of action, the movie delivers on most fronts here rating fairly high as an action movie. Something closer to an Expendables or Terminator 3 than say a Get Carter.The story, while hardly groundbreaking, is ok for an action movie. If you're thinking it's a drama, it's not. It's a stereotypical popcorn flick. The plot is a little like Looper but (spoiler alert) ends on a more positive note.Overall, if you're not expecting too much originality (other than in the digital younger version of Will Smith) and you like action films, you will probably find it entertaining.I would give it between 6/10 and 7/10 somewhere around the same type of score I would give a movie like Terminator 3. Slightly above average for its genre but not groundbreaking. For example, I would give a movie in this genre like The Matrix something closer to a 9/10 or 10/10 due its groundbreaking technology as well as original plot (definitely not for its acting!)."

Above all, the technology accomplished the goals set out by the project in terms of de-aging someone and making it look super believable. Throw in that most of the technology comes together to make for action scene spectaculars that will have fans dancing in their seats in excitement at this fast-paced feature. Sadly, the reviewers are right that the plot and characters are very simplistic, with a predictable and low developed plot shoved into the run time, where focus on action leads to hasty wrap ups and a sloppy finish for this reviewer. Perhaps if more time had been looked into the plot as the technology it would have pleased more, but for the wait, well it is not quite worth it for this guy.

      "review": "If you missed the trailers for Will Smith's futuristic nail-biter \"Gemini Man,\" then the surprise about an hour into this globe-trotting, stunt-laden saga might surprise you. Had you seen the trailers, you'd know what was in store, so it isn't quite the revelation it could have been. You'd think Paramount Pictures might have been more circumspect about this colossal spoiler. Whatever the case, cease reading asap or forever gnash your teeth. \"Gemini Man\" is a heavy-handed, formulaic melodrama about cloning and killing humans with impunity. Specifically, an older as well as a younger Will Smith dodges each other's bullets in \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\" director Ang Lee's fifteen film. The CGI version of the younger Will Smith, appropriately named Junior, is impeccable, but the \"Men in Black\" star betrays no signs of acting with a cybernetic double. According to the Internet Movie Database, \"Goosebumps'\" scribe Darren Lemke's clone versus human screenplay made the rounds about 20 years ago in Tinseltown before \"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\" writer David Benioff and \"Overlord's\" Billy Ray most recently rewrote it! Reportedly, over time, actors such as Clint Eastwood, Harrison Ford, Mel Gibson, Sean Connery, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, Brad Pitt, and Tom Cruise had been approached to star in this movie. Unfortunately, the CGI technology available then was not deemed practical. Meanwhile, you may have seen one, if not all three films about older men tangling with their younger clones. Among them was the 2001 Jean-Claude Van Damme thriller \"Replicant,\" the tenth Trek movie \"Star Trek: Nemesis\" (2002), and the final Hugh Jackson X-Men epic \"Logan\" (2017). Half of the problem with \"Gemini Man\" is it takes itself far too seriously when you consider all its outlandish elements.The best U.S. Government assassin alive decides to retire before he is retired. No sooner has patriotic protagonist Henry Brogan (Will Smith of \"Suicide Squad\") stowed his hardware than he finds lead swarming in the air around him. Moreover, the guy ordered to ice him looks a lot like him! In the only memorable scene in \"Gemini Man,\" Ang Lee stages a swerving adrenalin-laced motorcycle chase between the assailant in hot pursuit of the hero through traffic on a two-lane street. The younger Smith smacks around the other Smith with the rear tire of his stolen motorcycle, as if he were striking him with both sides of his hand alternately in the snap of fingertips. Afterward, he loosens the entire motorcycle, and the bike knocks him down! Sadly, everything looks routine in their cat & mouse maneuvers when they engage each other. Perhaps the most unforgettable thing about \"Gemini Man\" is the groan-inducing final surprise unveiled near fadeout. Clearly, Smith fears the encroachment of middle age, but he should display greater concern for the quality of his films. \"Gemini Man\" suffers by comparison with an earlier Smith exercise in espionage director Tony Scott's \"Enemy of the State\" (1998).\"Gemini Man\" opens with a provocative marksmanship scene in sunny Belgium. Henry Brogan awaits the shot of a lifetime at a bullet train gliding through the countryside like a lightning-fast mechanical worm. The target on the train sitting next to the window is supposed to be a biochemist who has turned terrorist. Brogan's spotter aboard the train (E.J. Bonilla of \"Mamitas\") provides him with the necessary statistics crucial to his aim. At the last moment child wanders into our hero's line of fire and he has to wait interminably as the seconds elapse to take his shot. Nevertheless, once the girl is clear, Brogan put a bullet into the rogue biochemist. No, he doesn't burst his brains. Instead, this otherwise spectacular shot skewers the biochemist's neck and kills him stone dead! The experience leaves a bad taste in Henry's mouth, and he worries that this-his 73rd kill-may be a hint to hang up his hardware. Later, one of his old pals from his Marine Corps days, Jack Willis (Douglas Hodge of \"Red Sparrow\") invites him out to his yacht and spills the beans to Henry about the biochemist's identity. More to his surprise than our surprise, Henry discovers he had duped about the identity of the biochemist. Naturally, our hero hates it that his own people lied to him. Initially, he chews out his go-between guy, Del Patterson (Ralph Brown of \"Amistad\"), about the biochemist's data sheet being spiked with falsified material. Patterson proclaims his innocence, and Henry wonders if his immediate superior, Janet Lassiter (Linda Emond of \"Across the Universe\"), has double-crossed him. Now, Brogan starts looking over his shoulder. What Henry doesn't know is that he is about to become the target of a private contractor, Clay Varris (Clive Owen of \"Killer Elite\"), head of a top-secret black ops unit codenamed \"GEMINI,\" who has already tried to kill him once.\"Gemini Man\" starts out as just another paranoid assassin whose bosses refuses to let him quit without a bullet in the head. Along the way, Henry picks up a friend and an ally in the boat rental manager at his marina. Danny Zakarweski (Mary Elizabeth Winstead of \"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter\") poses as a college marine biology student. Actually, she is an undercover Defense Intelligence Agency operative who eventually breaks down under Henry's relentless interrogation. She is surprised when the same assassins who come for Henry also have dispatched a team to kill her, too! Happily, Danny is one tough cookie, and she handles firearms as if she were born to fight.\"Gemini Man\" plunges down a predictable path from fade in to fadeout. You can guess what is going to happen before it occurs. You know the hero is neither going to die nor will he cap his clone with extreme prejudice. Apart from an abrasive motorcycle chase, the camaraderie between Henry and Danny stands out. They make a good team as they think their way into a predicament and then blast their way out of it. Unfortunately, \"Gemini Man\" is a second-rate thriller with a worn-out gimmick."

With the mirror telling him his age, Henry hands in his firearm (not withstanding the arsenal under his stairs) to spend more time going fishing and doing the crossword.But all is not well when Henry's 'one for the road' hit turns out to not be quite what it seems.Teaming up with marina manager Danny (Danny??) Zakarweski (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), the pair go on the run from operatives of a government-funded black-ops organization called Gemini. Gemini is a private semi-military organization (didn't we just go here with \"Angel Has Fallen\"?!). These 'baddie goodies' would rather see Henry - and all who know him - fed to the fishes rather than have him catching them.But one of these guys, under the direct command of Gemini-boss Clay Verris (Clive Owen), looks kinda familiar...Let's focus on the positives for a minute. This is a spy movie that has all of the polish that the recent \"Angel has Fallen\" didn't have. Some nice photogenic locations fly in and out again (Georgia, Budapest and Colombia: the latter for no obvious reason I can remember!). It occasionally reminded me of a glossy Bond film, but without Bond.There are also some high-class special effects (the special effects coordinator is Mark Hawker). A moonlit CGI Gulfstream with a zoom into the cockpit is particularly impressive.Some of the action set pieces also entertain. A Will-on-Will bike chase is well done, and I've not seen a bike used as a hand-to-hand weapon in this way before!And Will Smith is no doubt a class act, with his 'youngification' (I'm not sure what the official word is) also being effectively done. I also enjoyed Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who was great in \"10 Cloverfield Lane\". The lady has real screen presence.But man oh man, that script. Let's name the guilty parties in this film: the scriptwriters David Benioff (Game of Thrones), Darren Lemke and Billy Ray. (I'll put Ray last in the list, since the story was by Benioff and Lemke and this has the smell to me of Ray - who has a history of some great scripts like Captain Phillips under his name - being drafted in to steady a listing ship).Some of the dialogue in this film is not just a bit dodgy. It's head in the hands groan-worthy (and I actually did at times: fortunately the cinema was barely half full and I was on my own in the whole row). And some of it is just plain offensive. Henry meets his old pal Jack Willis (Douglas Hodge) on his yacht where he explains his wife is on a trip to Paris as a scantily clad dolly-bird wanders past. Henry comically rolls his eyes at this adulterous behaviour, with some sort of \"Jack, what are you loike!\" comment. Cringe-worthy.Will Smith, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Benedict Wong (their ally, adding some comic relief) are clearly good actors. But the script often makes them look utterly vacuous and stupid. And Lee seems to have a \"good enough, move on\" approach to the filming. One jaw-dropping moment has Will Smith telling the others that they are going to Budapest. \"Budapest?\" Winstead and Wong are supposed to say in union, but mistime it. \"Can we do that again?\". Nope. It's on the screen.As for Clive Owen... sorry, he's really not in the same acting league, and the script does him even fewer favours. As he says at one point \"It's like the Hindenburg crashing into the Titanic\". I couldn't have put it better myself.\"Uncanny Valley\". You know this phrase. The Princess Leia and Moff Tarkin scenes in \"Rogue One\" is the classic example. Effects that don't quite work on the big screen. \"But\" - you say to yourself - \"Dr Bob just said that the 'youngification' of Will Smith was done really well?\". And I'll repeat again that it was. It's on a par with Samuel L. Jackson's 'youngification' in \"Captain Marvel\". Where something strange happens is in the film's overall projection. Ang Lee has tried again with his experiment of filming at a massive 120 frames per second..... five times the normal movie frame rate of 24 fps. And the quality of the picture - particularly during high-speed action scenes - becomes outstandingly good! But equally it just doesn't 'look right'.When the human eye presumably works at an equivalent \"fps\" of thousands of 'frames per second' you'd think that it should all be fine. But for some reason I just found it distracting. Presumably the audiences for \"The Jazz Singer\" thought the same about sound; and those for \"Gone with the Wind\" and the \"Wizard of Oz\" about colour. Maybe we've seen the future, and its the new norm that we just need to get used to. We'll see.Ang Lee's \"Life of Pi\" was extraordinary. His \"Hulk\" was one of the poorest of the Marvel canon. Unfortunately, this movie is at the \"Hulk\" end of the spectrum. Which is a real shame. The duo of the 51 year old Smith and the 35 year old Winstead work really well together. They have great chemistry, but, you'll be relieved to hear, avoid any icky love interest.What a shame. With a different script, and some good production values, this could have been a very different story.(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the interweb and Facebook.

      "title": " Decent Popcorn Flick. Worth seeing in 3D-HFR.",
      "review": "TL;DR The story, acting, and plot are standard popcorn action movie. The 3D-HFR is new technology that is worth seeing in the theatre to see where the industry is heading. It improves the action and visuals to be more realistic and less exaggerated. The cinematography, sound, and 3D was really good.Detailed Review: The plot is not ground breaking or new as others have mentioned. The technology and technical aspects is where this movie is noteworthy (think Avatar). Based on the many reviews it appears some may be distracted by the tech.The HFR adds a higher definition and more detail that is hidden in the standard 24 frames per second (FPS). The human mind will fill in gaps when they read books and watch TV/Movies. For those not familiar, HFR is to movies what 1080p HD is to TV broadcast. The higher definition provides so much detail the mind does not need to fill in the gaps, so acting cues and facial expressions are more noticeable. The acting was on par for an action movie. The higher detail allows viewers to be more critical than what is normal.The HFR also changes the tone of the medium. It affects VFX and practical special effects. The cinematography took advantage of the HFR and I thought it was well done. The explosions and action scenes looked more realistic and less like a 1980's action TV show than many current action films. HFR is the future of movies. It will take time for the audience/critics to adapt.The Real3D was noticeably improved in this format. Oddly, the screen cloth was visible and you can tell if the characters were behind the screen or in front of the screen due to the deeper 3D effect. The depths were more clear where it felt like it was filmed in 3D vs re-rendered in post production. The CGI character of Junior (the younger Will Smith) was very lifelike. A few instances you could tell it was CGI by the movement of the character but the detail was great. There are few instances of better CGI characters. If the reviews concern you, see it early in the day when tickets are cheaper. If you are into the technical side of movies, It is worth watching in the theater in the 3D-HFR format."

This movie would have been great if anyone else was the lead actor. Please retire cause all your movies are horrible. MIB, MIIB, MIIIB, After Earth, S Squad, 7 pounds, pursue of happiness, concussion, I am legion, collateral beauty, focus, Hitchcock, i robot, bright, Ali, wild Wild West to name a few.

They stand behind a wooden fence and a new technology super machine gun that shoots 500 rounds a second fails to destroy it and they hide behind that lol? It's a 12 Age rated movie but come on lol.

Its kind of like that awkward kid from school that tried to be cool but in the end looked like a try hard idiot...Yeah that's this film. Why was this film made with a high farm-rate of 120 fps? That type of filming wasn't necessary. There was only a few action scenes which weren't high scale at all. One of them I couldn't even see what was going on, they actually needed Mrs. Winstead to wave a gun around with a light on it for us to see anything. What happened to sympathy in this film's universe? Every character that died had no emotion on any of the characters. One died the characters would move on and you wouldn't hear anything else about them. Its sad how this film had a budget over 130 million because this film could have had half that as long as the script was better. This film had a great concept and could have been the next sci-fi action franchise but this unfortunately did not work."

No. But if nothing else, it was fascinating to watch a film with that level of clarity and definition. You could definitely tell the difference that filming at a 120 frame rate, it was almost like looking through a window. A little bit jarring at times, but I can see the potential that it has for future movies.The movie suffers from some bad and unmotivated dialogue as well as underdeveloped characters. Will Smith has an amazing ability to portray every character he touches as believable and yet the whole movie still felt a little flat.Personally, I liked the action scenes. A lot of action movies suffer from poor camera angles and dark rooms to hide the magic of the fight choreography but I thought they did pretty well with this one. Although I did think that the characters must be robots at some point because wow could they survive some crazy stuff, but hey, I'll suspend my disbelief because that's Hollywood baby.Overall, if you are going into this movie wanting a cerebral, mind-blowing experience you will undoubtably be disappointed. But if you are going to see an action flick, it's really not too bad."

      "review": "It seems almost every year we have some of the same looking action films from some of the same exact actors, with new names. Gemini Man is the epitome of a standard action film. There are some moments that visual director Ang Lee implements that provide it with excitement albeit insanely ridiculous, but overall it follows all too familiar plotting and formulaic writing that everyone has seen before. The biggest drawback is that it copies so much from Looper in the fact that it's a younger version of a protagonist going up against his older version only different because its not time travel, and it's a clone factor. The cgi for young will smith clone is impressive enough but seems a bit extravagant. There are some genuinely well executed action sequences but they're highly unbelievable, but it does serve as action eye candy. Will Smith is standard as usual and not much else. Clive Owen is somewhat interesting in this particular role and gives it some identity. There's just not much new to offer here but it is a fun film if you enjoy action and don't get too annoyed that its been conceived before."

Yes you have to admit that the script is pretty flat, dude come on this script is already 20 years old. But we really should focus on the presentation. 120fps really worked. I watch this film at Dolby cinema (2K 120fps 3D), and I really need to take a second to admire the camera set. With the application of the 120fps, everything become so lively, every detail just become so real. You can clearly see their moves in the night fight without motion blur, you can see every spark, every fragment when glass was broken by a bullet, you can feel the pressure when the camera is looking up underwater. Again, the liveness is being greatly increased. And it's really astonishing. Also, beside the screen play and the 120fps, other parts of this film are finished in a really good way. The mise-en-scine, moving long take and the others...are really good. So please, don't miss the point of this film. The HIGH FRAME RATE ( HFR) is being promoting all by Ang Lee himself. It's a long hard way, but it's might be the trend of the future. Just.. go to the theater aroud you, which can provide you as high as they can in frame rate. The difference is obivious. It's not about the screen play, it's about how it was presented."

It's also offered in MX4D, and that's probably why this movie has a problem. it seems to be made for 4D, because of the acting and editing. Through the entire movie there are scenes that build up to the action that would be enhanced by 4D. so basically it feels like it's made to let you experience 4D But then there's the cgi and that's where the movie really misses the mark. young Will Smith often doesn't look like young Will Smith, but like a bad computer animated person, that lipsyncs with the dialogue just a fraction too late. His lips don't move naturally, the eyes are wider than they should be, tears in his eyes look fake and the acting is slightly too slow, probably to make it possible to make Will Smith look that much younger.I have to say, the movie, no matter how unrealistic the plot is and how often there are wtf moments, still is pretty enjoyable. It sometimes felt like a James Bond movie, American Style (over the top, bigger than big). I had a good time, just wouldn't do ScreenX again and think the movie could have been much better if the editing and special effects were better."

But I had to fight the urge to leave the cinema from start: Inspite the 3D HFR it looked as flat as watching the average Netflix vehicle.How can they make a production on the big screen look worse than the average soap on a poorly adjusted TV set? Was it too bright, was the contrast too low, was the digital sharpness too high? It is very hard to pin it down but I never saw this in cinema before.Ok, technical it was a disaster! Scriptwise not too strong either but the second half it felt almost as a different movie. Stunts were entertaining, weaponizing motorbikes Jacky Chan style is fun to see.Honestly I thought \"Bright\" was the worst Will Smith ever was involved with but this evening I learned this movie is a very poor experiment. And it's not about the poor script or actors performance. It is the technical excecution or production. I hope the future is not more 3D HFR, at least not before it has evolved to someting watchable.

Unfortunately for everyone in 2019 we didn't get that, instead we were given a film that is mind numbingly boring with some of the worst CGI I've seen in a long while.Now I completely understand that this \"de-aging\" technology is still in its infancy, so there are going to be a few hurdles for it to overcome. Although the fantastic artists and people behind the film tried there best at making the effects looking jaw dropping..........in a way they did but for all the wrong reasons. There is no getting round it the effects of \"Young Will Smith\" just look so out of place, especially in some of the action scenes it looks almost video game like. Maybe that was the direction they were going for or it was bad effects, either way it doesn't look good.Unfortunately its hard to focus on anything else in the film because it takes your attention way so much...............and also the bigger problem that there was nothing else to take your attention away. Don't get me wrong Will Smith, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Clive Owen all looking like there at least trying to do something. However the script their given is incredibly boring and unfortunately very cliche.........everything about the film is almost a cliche of a bad 80's or 90's action film with really bad CGI.Overall its pretty poor 45% out of 100 or 4.5 out of 10, I am sure that there is a story here to be told but it has to be put into better hands in terms of writing and directing............and to wait for the technology to develop, so its at a stage where it can be used properly.

The conversation in the film feel so weird and boring! The action also not satisfy at all! First action scene, Henry shot dead a man on a train! This scene just saw the bullet hitting the window of the train! Super bored! Second action scene, a bunch of man went to the fishing recreation house to kill Henry! Henry shot dead several person! This scene still not intense! Third action scene, the woman in charge of the fishing recreation center \"Danny\" fight with a man assault her! This scene have some things broken but still nothing near intense! She broke the man's teeth even not show to us! Fourth action scene, the first younger self of Henry \"Junior\" try to kill him at Columbia! They fight in a house with gun and grenade! Later, Junior riding a motorbike chasing him out the street and eventually runaway after the police arrive! This scene actually a bit intense! Have some explosion in the house and hallway collapse scene! The chasing on the street scene, have some car been ram, Junior throwing the motorbike at Henry and explode, he using another motorbike chasing Henry and constantly ram him to death! Fifth action scene, this scene not even is an action scene! A bunch of people disguise as civilian and causing havoc! Turnout, it's just a training scene! Sixth action scene, Henry fight with Junior in a bunker and eventually fell into a place full of water! This scene have some martial art and breaking the wall scene , but still not satisfy at all! The last action scene, is the most intense scene! Junior fight with Clay on the rooftop! Henry and Danny shooting on the street! Henry and Junior fighting with second younger self of Henry in a shop! The rooftop scene have some martial art fighting! The street scene have some explosion! Inside the shop scene actually quite impressive! The second younger self of Henry keep hitting and burning by his opponent and he still survive every move! He eventually kill by explosion cause by Danny! Henry prevent Junior to kill Clay and he kill Clay all by himself! At the end, Junior back to school, Henry and Danny talking with him along the way! That's it!

Neck wrinkles are neither sexy not distinguished - again, looking at you Mister Douglas.JLo can't act and there's something about her voice I can't stand. Whatever that annoying quality, I didn't hear it here. I'll give this to her as well, for a fifty years old mother of twins, that body is banging. You could bounce quarters off that bod.This movie was meant to entertain. Period. And it did. Sunday afternoon matinee was pretty packed and the audience enjoyed it.Men who are butthurt over the premise (strippers drugging and robbing men) , I ask are you offended when men drug and rape women?

The film struggles mightily - and ultimately fails - to justify why two wrongs make a right.Most everything in a good Robin Hood -type story is missing or underplayed. The \"bad\" Wall Street guys getting fleeced in the movie are rarely shown behaving horribly. Oh, we are told they steal from the Firefighters retirement fund... while they are off-screen... but they are not visually portrayed as very menacing or degrading to the lady strippers. Hell, by the end of the movie, even the main protagonist's character (played by Constance Wu) is feeling sorry for the stupid saps her crew is robbing.And what of this merry little band? Here an attempt is at least made to provide the audience with a jolly, free-spirted, group of bandits to bond with. I assume those coming away from this movie with positive impressions were simply better than I at relating to the troop of thieves at the story's center.The problem with J Lo's frisky little group - and ultimately the movie - is that they cannot escape the reality of their actions. They were not out to steal from the rich and to give to the poor. Sadly, Hustlers is less a tale of female empowerment than it is a story about criminals - who happen to be women - seeking to enrich themselves."

The only thing that it might bring for some is some nostalgia of your strip club days in the mid to late 2000's.The only other known actor in this movie is Julia Stiles but she has a very small role and isn't really part of the movie at all.Overall, the first half of the movie is tolerable.

Women should not be empowered by becoming better *criminals* than the men they loathe. Plenty of other classy women out there, liberal and conservative, who can empower urban youth.

      "title": " Scafaria and Lopez make it rain in \"Hustlers\"",
      "review": "We all know how the Great Recession of 2008 affected the American economy. There are countless stories of large financial and automotive firms going under, taking thousands of employees with them. But one industry you may not have heard of that had one of the biggest direct impacts on workers: strip clubs.Based on a true story, \"Hustlers\" tells the story of four New York female strippers as they scam and crawl their way out of the financial crisis that left their usual Wall Street clients with no money to flaunt.Probably one of the most fun movies of the year, \"Hustlers\" flows with great kinetic energy that makes it endlessly entertaining. Director Lorene Scafaria takes a lot of influence from the works of Martin Scorsese and Adam McKay (also a producer on the film) as she effortlessly keeps the movie going at top speed. Watching this, you're reminded of great films like \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" and \"Goodfellas\",Scafaria also shows off her great productional talent as she makes use of several slow-motion montages mixed with a perfect soundtrack of mid-2000s R&B hits. Numerous moments of fluid camerawork that mix both quick cuts and long takes give the film a fresh and brisk pace.There's one moment where all these great facets come together in a surprise meta-cameo from a well-known singer/dancer. The perfect music choice, the choreography of the dancers, and the blocking of the movement make it the most exciting and memorable scene in the film.In addition to directing, Scafaria also pens the script, imbuing the narrative with the themes of family and sisterhood. We see the four women come together and follow the journey of bonding through redemption. Sometimes it does get close to \"Fast & Furious\" levels of overdoing it, but the strong performances from the leads make it believable to watch.Scafaria also uses a flashback framework structure as the story cuts between the past and present with the quartet plunging deeper into the moral grey areas of their actions. There's a constant feeling of having already seen this technique done before several times. However, it's very interesting to see this kind of story told not from the demeaning point of view that plagues similar films, but an unmalicious female perspective.Scafaria does slip up when it comes to the moral reasoning of the actions and character development as they are both put to the sideline in favor of more dancing scenes. In her defense, the dancing scenes are the best part of the film and a treat to watch. But they each start to become empty near the end as the lack of depth and ethical stakes become too obvious to ignore.Holding the story together are two excellent performances from the leading ladies of Constance Wu and Jennifer Lopez.After her breakout hit in last year's \"Crazy Rich Asians\", Wu here turns in another star-making performance as Destiny. With the good material Scafaria gives her, she sinks deep into her character and shows off her more dramatic chopsJennifer Lopez, surprisingly fifty years old, plays Ramona and is the best she's been in a long time. She struts that movie star glow that keeps your eyes always glued to her, especially during her more physical scenes that give off a sense of both grace and power.The rest of the supporting cast is stunt cast with the likes of Cardi B and Lizzo, who play themselves. They each don't mean anything to the story apart from their name value on the poster.\"Hustlers\" is one of the sleekest and entertaining movies to come out this year. While its politics may be a bit skimp and misguided from time to time, the brilliant directing by Scafaria and powerhouse performances by Wu and Lopez make this a great time well worth your investment."

I've never cared one way or the other about Jennifer Lopez-- saw her in a couple of so-so movies, found her acting mediocre-- but my wife and I both liked \"Hustlers\" and thought Lopez' performance was outstanding.It appears to me that a good many of those criticizing this movie view it as trying to be a female empowerment movie, and as celebrating the characters' criminal activities portrayed in it. I don't think that's what the movie was doing at all.I always review the movies I see for my own records, just to jog my memory later on. Here's what I wrote about this one:Constance Wu stars as Destiny, a young Chinese-American girl driven to stripping to make ends meet, but Jennifer Lopez (\"J Lo\") easily steals the movie in the costarring role as Ramona, the veteran stripper who takes Destiny under her wing. After a while they and a couple more stripper pals graduate to steering well-to-do Wall Street johns into the club for a cut of what they get them to spend (which can run into thousands), and finally to drugging them to get it done more quickly and surely.The screenplay (based on a real case chronicled in an article in New York Magazine) is intelligent and believable, so is the dialogue, and all the acting is very good. All except Jennifer Lopez, because \"very good\" isn't strong enough for her, she's really outstanding in the role, a performance without a single false note.The relationship between Destiny and Ramona does not appear to be sexual, yet you could say the whole movie is really their love story. The music is good too, and the eye candy is wall-to-wall.All in all: A fun flick with some intelligence and depth to it."

Wu and Lopez are tremendous, their chemistry is the beating heart of the film. Again, this is the type of movie that only a female filmmaker can compellingly bring to cinemas.A love letter to female friendship and a scathing critique of an economic system that objectifies and undermines women, \"Hustlers\" is an unlikely hybrid of subversive-revenge crime saga and pop-feminist \"chick-flick.\" It's an uproarious independent film AND a thoughtful, critical, heartfelt studio picture."

The main characters, Ramona (Jennifer Lopez) and Destiny (Constance Wu) are strippers who drug men with ketamine and MDMA and then rob them. \"Hustlers\" is based on real events. The real madame of the real-life Hustlers gang was Samantha Barbash. She and her former partners have publicly stated that the men they robbed deserved it. One said, \"It sounds so bad to say that we were, like, drugging people. But it was, like, normal.\" These are not nice people.The film works hard to convince us that these gals are sweethearts, that America offered them no economic opportunities other than sex work and theft, and that the men deserved to be drugged and robbed. Yes there is a lot of naked female flesh in \"Hustlers.\" Viewers who want to see a porn show involving two women fondling each other to entertain a man in a private room, pole dancers, and naked boobs, this is the movie for you. The film also celebrates greed. There are long sequences that consist of nothing but the thieves purchasing and fondling chinchilla jackets, high-heeled shoes, and luxury automobiles. There are also lengthy scenes where the extended network of thieves Ramona has organized get together and give each other expensive presents, dance and laugh together.What's not to like? A couple of things. For some people, and no doubt Jennifer Lopez is among them, women are valuable to the extent that they are sexual objects for men. \"Hustlers\" is for and about that narrow slice of a woman's experience. There is scant attention paid to women as family members, thinkers, creators. Yes, yes, there are exploitative, tacked-on scenes of the women with their kids, but it's clear that babysitters are raising those kids, not their mothers. One of the characters spends about sixty seconds pretending to read a book in order to study for a GED. Wow, a scholar.What's really despicable about \"Hustlers\" is its utter dishonesty. Lopez worked really hard to make her pole stripping authentic. She didn't care about being honest about the women she was bringing to the screen. The film insists that these women had to strip and they had to steal because America is an economic wasteland that provides no other employment opportunities to women. The film also constantly waves around the strippers' daughters as justification. I have a daughter at home! I have to strip and steal from men!Destiny goes to a high-end department store to apply for a job as a clerk. Destiny is impeccably courteous and obviously desperate. The boss treats Destiny with exaggerated contempt and refuses to hire her. It's a ridiculous, unbelievable scene.By insisting that sex work and theft are the only ways a woman can survive, by celebrating greed with lustful close-ups of chinchilla jackets, \"Hustlers\" insults every woman who doesn't do sex work and who doesn't steal. My mother brought up six kids while working full time in factories and cleaning houses. Jennifer Lopez would have to work hard, and not on a pole, to be the woman my mother was."

      "review": "I'm sorry to say, this movie is just bad. The only way it can be good is if someone tells me the entire point was to see the trailer, go to the movies and feel like you were hustled when u got out.It looks as if the director just finished school and wanted to use every movie style she possibly could in just one flick, but with out any connection to anything what so ever. Or maybe she just watched Netflix and thought she could do the \" is it a comedy ? Is it a drama ? Nobody knows \" but, very very poorly (unlike Netflix).I am in-love with JLo and she was actually good in this but even she, could not save this poorly made film.The characters are not relatable at all, at all ! The storyline and most of the dialogue are so boring, it's as if they just filmed a boring conversation through most of it, very lazy. The soundtrack moves between Buffy the vampire slayer moms death scene To Saturday Night live, To a cheesy 90's comedy, this makes no since what so ever and if the sound editors / director knew what they were doing, it could.To summarize:This movie was like a really bad dish made out of the best possible ingredients. I didn't get it, at all."

      "title": " Lopez Steals the Show but Solid Acting and Camaraderie Makes Hustlers Entertaining",
      "review": "When you're watching a movie about bad people doing bad things (gangster movies, financial crime pictures etc.) its naturally hard to sympathize with the characters. The movie has to do the extra work so you can picture walking in their shoes so you can see why the characters are doing what they're doing. My blueprint for accomplishing this (or the best template to follow) is the Martin Scorsese comedy The Wolf of Wall Street. Jordan Belfort (the protagonist played by Leonardo DiCaprio) and his buddy are TERRIBLE human beings, they're criminals, they're bigots and sexists and they don't care whose lives their ruining to get what they want (bigger parties, more women and most of all more money). But the ride is so crazy and watching them just splurge on anything and everything, its so fun that you let go of your morality just to join them on this journey. This is something that Hustlers manages to do and if this hadn't been accomplished, the movie would have dropped like a stone. The actions of Ramona (Jennifer Lopez), Destiny (Constance Wu) and their partners in crime are awful, sure their victims are @$$holes, but they're still drugging them, stealing all of their money then using their positions as strippers to shame them into not reporting them. If the genders were switched, this would be a horror movie. Luckily, the camaraderie between the girls is so strong and its so fun to watch them enjoy the fruits of their labours, you can put the morality of their actions aside and just follow them. I enjoyed watching this movie just for the performances and the vibe it exudes with these women pulling one over on \"The Man.\"I try to never count actors or actresses out, you never know if they're going to get that rebound role that suits their talents or if they just haven't been pitched on that movie that will make their career. Maybe they're taking gigs just for the paycheque? For example, I really disliked Robert Pattison and then I saw him in Water for Elephants and The Lost City of Z and I realized that maybe he wasn't a hack after all. Jennifer Lopez is another performer who falls in this category for me. She's always been beautiful but I've never liked her work as an actress or as a singer. Hustlers was that movie that changed my mind about her. The movie highlights how stunning she is but I thought her performance in this was excellent. She commanded the screen, she exuded power and confidence whenever the camera was on her and she made you want to believe in Ramona even after she turned the corner. She also had really good chemistry with Wu and the rest of the cast. I applaud her for her work here, I don't know if she'll win an Oscar but this is the best work I've seen from her and I wouldn't be surprised if there's some award recognition her future.This is not to sell Wu short either, this is a big departure from Crazy Rich Asians and Hustlers shows she has a lot of range. I already mentioned that Lopez and her work well together butWu helps carry the viewer through this wild ride. She manages to be funny but she also digs deep in the more serious moments. This is solid work for sure. The supporting cast was really good across the board. I want to credit Keke Palmer, Lili Reinhart, Julia Stiles (who is good but very low key) and Mercedes Ruehl for performing capably and they all had their moments. The only one I'll single out is Cardi B, she isn't bad but she's playing it up really hard and she could have toned it down just a little.This movie does have some minor hurdles to get over. The first is the aforementioned morality problem which the movie both addresses but also sweeps under the rug. I didn't have a problem with it but it is a present issue. The next is that if you take a step back and look at the arc of the plot, this is also the generic rise and fall gangster story. Its filmed beautifully and its a lot of fun, but if you need something wholly original, this movie doesn't cut it. My final point is that they really rush the segment where the girls get their comeuppance. The movie ends like someone skimming the last few pages and then slams the book shut. I don't know if they thought it was running long and they needed to wrap it up or if that just wasn't the focus but it ends pretty abruptly.I enjoyed this more than I expected to. I did get to the movie 5-10 minutes late, I saw this with a friend and we entered right when JLO was doing her first dance (it was an awkward moment to enter when you're seeing this with a female friend). It does follow the same beats as a lot of other stories but I credit director Lorene Scafaria and her creative team for finding a new angle on this type of story and the cinematography is noteworthy for a movie that just takes place in the city. Hustlers isn't flawless but it more than does enough to get the job done. If the subject matter doesn't make you squeamish (which it shouldn't... maybe don't watch this with the kids though) check it out on your preferred streaming service. I would tell you to see it in the theatre but I'm late getting this review up and its probably gone by now."

      "review": "Hustlers 2019 15 director: Lorene Scafaria starring: Jennifer Lopez,Constance Wu,Keke Palmer,Cardi B,Lizzo,Julia stiles,Lili reinhart etcoverall rating 91/100Hustlers is based around Destiny ( Constance Wu) who is trying to make a living at a strip club for her grandma. And When Ramona ( jennifer lopez) gives her an opportunity to make more money by getting money from the men who wronged them in the past they form not only a friendship but a business. Hustlers really surprised me at the quality of the film. It was not just a film about strippers. There was depth,importance and a certain cleverness in the plot and script that makes this film important lets talk about this.First of all the film was actually really funny in multiple places. The humour felt more natural instead of forced due to the connection all the characters had there humour was like any other close friendship in real life so it made the characters more relatable and easy to connect to. Plus i would definitely say Cardi b and Jennifer lopez definitely bought the most amount of humour to the film despite everyone doing a good job.Next i thought the acting performances here were fantastic. Particularly highlighting cardi B,Jennifer lopez and constance wu. Cardi B despite her lack of screen time went all out in displaying her bubbly and wild personality and for this type of film it just worked and due to her past career she would of been in her comfort zone so this kind of role really suited her. Next constance Wu. She was fantastic in Hustlers. She really sold the emotional moments of the film,but yet also had a very likeable charm throughout that made you like her character and respect her decisions. And finally for Jennifer Lopez undeniably the best performance in the film and in her career. she oozed leading women material as soon as she set on the camera and this kind of attitude stayed throughout the whole film. She was somebody that all the characters could look up to and go to for support. This should really give Jlo a lot more respect as an actor and more movie roles should be coming her way. However i do have to say that some characters in my opinion were underused. Cardi Bs character was so likeable that i would of loved to of seen her in the film more as well as Lizzos character they unfortunately were only used in about 2/3 scenes and i just thought they could of been used more frequently.Next i loved i loved that the film had diversity and its soundtrack was fantastic. I just liked that there was a nice diverse cast which should be the norm in films these days but unfortunately is still a rarity so i am glad that there was cast members from multiple different countries and races. Next the soundtrack was fantastic. The music fitted with each scene and just made the film more entertaining in places.My last slight negative would be that there was a really random cameo from Usher. It just didn't really fit in with the film and felt very out of place for me but i can get how it works in other peoples eyes.But now for my last few big positives. First of all they had a good balance of having dislikeable characters vs having sympathy for the victims. Having the inhabitants of the strip club being rude old rich people really made you dislike them and not mind what the women would do to them so therefore there characters were more likeable. But also the film shared a good message of karma always comes back around to you. The gang got to power hungry and started stealing money from sweet innocent men that had families so it had a healthy balance of them both. And finally the film had really good character arcs. All the strippers actually had personalities and wasn't just used for meat as they didn't allow the men to manipulate them. It just was a fresh change and i think gave women that perhaps aren't viewed highly a voice. The characters did there jobs to feed there families and to look after them. Like Destiny ( Constance wu) had her grandma and eventually a child to look after and Ramona ( Jennifer lopez) also had a child that she loved and was willing to get extra cash. So the film did really well with going against gender stereotypes and it really worked for me.Overall Hustlers is a hilarious,surprisingly clever and different type of film filled with excellent performances that deserves all the positive attention its getting."

In addition to Lopez, the rest of the cast is also solid. The film closely retells a true story, but it is not clear what the filmmaker hopes the audience will learn from the experience.

      "title": " Hustlers has plenty of energy from its strong performances, good directing, and dramatic plot, but where it really shines is when it raises questions of moral ambiguity",
      "review": "Hustlers may feel like a predictable revenge narrative arc early on, where the women have success and get greedy and go too far, have lots of success and have it come crashing down. At the surface level, that is what's essentially going on, but beneath that questions of morality, victimization, and socioeconomic status lie without easy answers. I had heard the raves about JLo's performance, and she's undeniably very good, but Wu is just as strong in showcasing her character's inner turmoil and evolution. The direction does a good job of putting the viewer in the strip club environment, and tracking shots are employed early to encourage the connection we feel we have with Destiny. It was utterly unsurprising to me to see McKay listed as a producer, as the cross cuts between present day interviewing and the narrative being told felt straight out of his book. The most interesting question asked in Hustlers surrounds victimization - who was really the victim in the whole hustle, and is anyone involved morally redeemable? There are fascinating linkages consistently shown throughout the movie, particularly surrounding the flow of money. Ruthless businessmen profit in the finance world and then indulge in their vices, which in this film manifests as going to strip clubs. There they throw money away at the women for the superficial and physical entertainment of seeing them dance for them and being in control of the situation. The women, who are clearly viewed in a narrow and superficial aesthetic lens, show their own ruthlessness. Where the parallel is clearly distinct is in the two groups socioeconomic classes - the women haven't grown up with the same background or opportunities as most of the men, and have structural inequities that prevent them from greater financial success. Given these structural barriers, coupled with the financial crash which (from their perspective) was the fault of their former clients and who caused them to be jobless and poor, they get back at them with illegal measures. The superficial and surreptitious nature of the men's attendance at the clubs is used to the women's advantage, as in the short run the men wouldn't tell anyways because of their socioeconomic security. Clearly the extent to which they take it is completely wrong, and unsurprisingly it all catches up to them (though not nearly as much as you'd think - none of them end up having to do hard time!). The familial emotional stakes did feel a bit forced and not as emotionally developed as intended, and the women's relationship did feel fickle and solely based in financial success, though that may be part of the point. The seeming frivolity of their earnings through the hustle seemed an inconsistent juxtaposition with their demeanor in feeling like they had to keep going and had no other choice - they ended up spending it largely on luxury items like designer handbags, chic dresses, and posh cars and houses. There's nothing wrong with using money that way, but it's not exactly Robin Hood-esque in stealing from the rich for necessary and noble causes alone. There is quite a lot of moral ambiguity to unpack and many societal questions raised (made explicit by JLo's ending line using their dancing and hustling the men as a metaphor for how everyone in the world is just trying to get ahead by any means necessary). Even if it doesn't pull all of them off cleanly, it's quite a strong film with great ideas and performances."

I saw this a couple of days after I saw \"Joker,\" and it might sound funny to say, but they're kind of kindred movies. They both, in their respective ways, are an angry response to the increasing disparity -- economic, gender, racial, you name it -- plaguing American culture, and they're both about those being trampled deciding to do some trampling of their own for a change. Toward the end of \"Hustlers,\" Jennifer Lopez's character says something about how the whole world is one big hustle; there are those doing the hustling, and those paying for it. She also argues against playing by the rules when the rules are rigged from the start. If her character and Arthur Fleck, the sociopath brought brilliantly to life by Joaquin Phoenix in \"Joker,\" went on a date, they could have a field day jointly venting their disgust at the whole rotten system.Lopez is being bandied about as a potential Oscar nominee for her performance. I don't know about that. She's good, but I'm not sure her performance is much of a stretch for her, and it mostly consists of shots of her strutting toward the camera in slow motion, which she admittedly does very well. Most of the heavy lifting acting falls to Constance Wu, a woman who's just bad enough to team up with other strippers in drugging and robbing clueless guys but who isn't bad enough not to feel conflicted about it the whole time. Though we don't feel overly conflicted as an audience, since almost all the guys are rich white Wall Street jerks, and when was the last time anyone felt sorry for them?Grade: A-"

Its almost like having Harvey Weinstein make an appearance in a film about film producers abusing their power and taking advantage of actresses. 'Bardi' offered very little to the film.

      "review": "\"Hustlers\" (2019 release; 110 min.) is \"Inspired By a True Story\", we are reminded at the beginning. As the movie opens, it is \"2007\" and an Asian-American girl named Dorothy is getting ready for work at a strip club. Then a Latina woman named Ramona makes her grand entrance and does a spectacular pole dance as Fiona Apple's \"Criminal\" blasts from the speakers. Duly impressed, Dorothy reaches out to Ramona for some dancing tips, and the two hit it off. We then go to \"2014\" where we see Dorothy being interviewed by a journalist... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from writer-director Lorene Scafaria, whose \"Seeking a Friend For the End of the World\" some years ago was one of my favorite movies of that year. Here she takes a New York magazine article and turns it into a wild, wild movie. Beware: not much is left to the imagination. The grand entrance of Jennifer Lopez in that opening scene's pole dance is nothing short of stunning. In fact, the same can be said about Lopez's overall performance, which should be Oscar nomination-worthy, and certainly is a career-best performance. Lopez turned 50 this year, and looks about 35. She takes control of the movie, and requests, makes that demands, your attention. You are more than happy to give it to her. Constance Wu, Keke Palmer, and Lili Reinhardt round out the primary performers. Check out Cardi B and Lizzo (part of the strip gang). When a movie's principal set is a strip club, you can expect a lot of fist-pumping music, and the movie more than delivers on that level. In addition to the aforementioned Fiona, there are songs from Britney Spears, Janet Jackson (\"Control\", of course), Fat Joe, Queen She, 50 Cent, and many, many more.\"Hustlers\" premiered a few weeks ago at the Toronto International Film Festival to immediate acclaim, and was released wide last weekend (outperforming expectations at the box office). The Saturday matinee screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati in its second weekend of release was attended very nicely (a good 30 people in a small room). If you have an interest in seeing a gritty yet funny stripper drama starring an Oscar nomination-worthy Jennifer Lopez, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."

Destiny becomes a poledancer, is befriended by old hand Ramona, and all is well until the sub-prime crisis hits Wall Street, and the easy money dries up. Ramona develops a plan - if you and your friends pick up a mark, and slip him a concoction which renders him gaga, then you can max out his credit cards and tell him he had a great time afterwards, worth every penny, shame he can't remember it.This is based on a true story, and I can believe it. Jennifer Lopez is Ramona and Constance Wu is Dorothy. Both women swear prodigiously and wear little clothing (although always more than the other performers in the club). Both women also act well.But this film is not happy or edifying. What happens is not pleasant, and the female characters aren't particularly sympathetic. Maybe they are more sympathetic from a feminist standpoint, but I didn't care for them much. The film is too long by about half an hour, and I left the cinema without feeling that I had been entertained."

      "title": " A Really Tedious Snoozefest, This Was No Thriller!",
      "review": "HustlersThis was a kind of Pretty Woman without any redemption or indeed anything pretty.About half way through this movie I started to fidget and the whole thing just became a tedious snoozefest. We just had far too much repetition of the same scenarios on the screen, it was totally unvarying, and of course the main reason for this was there was in reality just too little story for any narrative drive. It was all padding!What was good and bad.1, the styling was comprehensive, agreed, but we had no sense of the fashion changes as we moved through nearly 10 years.2, woman were presented as universally strong, resourceful, compassionate, nurturers and care-givers, unsurprisingly women have not cornered this market even in 2007. There is no sisterhood of womankind, quite ridiculous.3, whilst it might be novel to see J-Lo in a thong, however considering her stage act it is hardly remarkable and certainly insufficient to sustain a movie.4, the method acting was good but shallow it just lay over the top of the fashions and the furs. There was little or no character development so there was little chance for any nuance.5, the use of Chopin's music tried to instil some class and 'romantic' emotion, pleasant agreed, but it clashed with the calculating, cold-hearted and unemotional characters on the screen.The Director clearly wanted us to like and understand the motivations of these women but this was just clearly not possible as they committed countless assaults and thefts caring little whether the victim lived or died.In conclusion I expected a thriller but there was nothing thrilling here about the tawdry lives of cruel woman predating on men to fleece them of their money. They were selfish and manipulating in their naked exploitation of men not caring about consequences and thus this movie offered no redemption. This could not even be nominated for an award let alone achieve one.In the case of \"times up\" and \"me too\" movements, this reversal of circumstances in a movie at this time is ill judged and the script writer and director should be ashamed."

      "review": "If I'm being honest, I feel as though the fact Hustlers has been released and is not being talked about as a candidate for one of the years worst films is some form of cinematic miracle.In what appeared to be film that could've easily have been the modern day Showgirls, group of working class strippers band together to rip off sleazy Wall Street and high rolling clients, Hustler's ability to overcome its seemingly doomed based on a true story premise is something that's worth noting and due largely to the fact Crazy Rich Asians breakout star Constance Wu and the sure to be awards nominated co-star Jennifer Lopez bring their A-games to Lorene Scafaria's feature.Now that we've celebrated the fact Hustlers has become a film with a rating in the high 80's on Rotten Tomatoes and high 70's on Metacritic, against the odds it now feels as though Hustlers has become one of the year's most unworthily praised films, in what's a sleazy and unlikable experience in the underbelly of New York City as a group of hard luck woman combine forces to manipulate and criminally drug supposed bad guys to gain a leg up in life.It's in this core concept in which Hustlers becomes an unlikable event, we're told and made to feel as though everyone Wu's Destiny and Lopez's Romona targets in their scheme, that sees them drugging their way around New York's high end players, are bad people, but it's hard to believe just because somebody is rich, automatically makes them someone it's OK to illegally drug, steal and gain from.There's very little enjoyment to be found from watching this rag-tag group of strippers enact their masterplan's on a collection of victims and while Hustlers starts out strong with Wu at first a likable enough central figure and Lopez as good as she's ever been as the street smart Romona, once Scafaria gets into the groove of the central plot-line that formed the basis of the news article in which Hustler's has been derived from, this film loses any of the entertainment value it could've potentially had.As the film wears one we become increasingly aware that there is no one here we can really root for, most of these characters have made their own bed and reap what they sow, there's nothing overtly placed in front of us that can make us shy away from the fact that these woman are just after a quick buck, in the some of the most depraved and dishonest means possible.When we set out to watch a gangster film we are not asked to enjoy the way they kill, rob and plunder their way to financial success but Hustler's problem is it feels as though its setting up its main group as some type of Robin Hood like woman, sticking it to the man and getting a slice of the pie they feel entitled to but there's no real reason why we want to see them achieve their goals at the detriment of everyone else around them, most of us end up being working class citizens, most of us live through hard times and most of us don't feel the need to drug and manipulate others to achieve financial gains.Final Say -A well shot film that's well acted by its main cast, Hustler's is supposed to feel grimy and dirty but it forgot to offer any real enjoyment for its viewers to take from a film that quite simply follows a collection everyday woman who decided their best bet at a good life was becoming monsters bigger than the supposed ones they were targeting for their personal means.2 Usher visits out of 5"

Strippers by proxy can not vocalize sincere ego fantasies, save in the privacy of other strippers or an autistic child who has not developed speech recognition, yet. The cliche of choosing a Slumdog profession to provide for mommy and kiddies is so redundant that I would place a dangerous bet, nearly 85% of Western women spit the same line during thier early 30s as the moment when some poor guy settled to take them home from the bar at Applebee's leaned more toward last call and the dishwasher than someone your mother would be jealous of. The saving grace is the hypocrisy of parody. Without deep insight, the cast and studio found it not only appropriate to celebrate theft through sexual seduction and narcotic inebriation. Fine by me, but maybe The Great Bill Cosby should receive equal respect.Moreso, per chance since he never stole from the women who likely visited him in private to extract a professional favor. I'm disappointed with with cultural embarrassment at the obvious tests perverting one reality as a horror and a near equal female version as inspirational and heroic. I'm mildly hoping for some old school hustlers who celebrate the .com without any ducks for the victims. That would be inspiring. I miss the gutter kids."

As a sex worker myself, I am exposed to the perspectives and activities of a wide array of sex workers on a daily basis. I have observed an increasing amount of sex workers who feel validated in their decisions to become con-artists, bragging proudly about robbing their own clients. While I'm happy that this is starting to be discussed in the mainstream media, that doesn't mean it's a pleasant thing to observe. It's tragic that in an era when sex work does seem to be getting to a place where it's more openly accepted, we have unabashed behavior like this which is going to make people second guess any progress we may have established thus far - it's heavily counterproductive. Overall, the movie mostly just made me feel frustrated, sad, and worried for the future - but it was the correlation to reality that I couldn't get off of my mind. I wasn't very enveloped in the world of the film itself - mostly just reminded of my worries regarding the industry and the way it's pupils and society will carry on being effected by on another from here on out.As a film alone, it was okay. The performances were sufficient but nothing that stood out, which is more a result of the writing. Uninteresting characters caught up in uninteresting events. Overall, the plot FEELS like it should be entertaining, but the movie is a bit redundant - once you get into the thick of it, you're basically watching a repetitive cycle with not much movement to it. And as it goes on, you kind of like the characters less and less, with no real conflicting energies - so it kind of just gets worse as it goes. The movie could have use some cutting - there's not enough depth or complexity to it to validate a nearly 2 hour run time, unfortunately.The movie did have a handful of very amusing moments, but it was not enough to redeem the thing as a whole.

Cinematography is exceptional, I saw at least 4-5 scenes that were absolutly suberb, in acting and imaging. Those type of scenes that you rembember and have goosebumps over. Sound, while not the best or memorable (at least not at first watch) as were The Fountain, Requiem for a Dream and others, it is still top notch and more important were perfectly match with what I was seeing. Last and clearly not least, Joaquin Pheonix....I read and seen quite a bit before going in \"ohhh people are walking out of the movie or it is bad...not PC enough, apolitical. ...etc\" all those messages are from critics that honestly follow a crooked agenda. My truth is I saw acting like I did not see for a loooong time. The descent inyo madness is palpable, relatable and real. Mr. Pheonix is incredible, suberb, breathtaking!

It brings out a sea of emotions from within where you feel pity for Joker sometimes or you feel that this guy has gone nuts and also makes you sick to the stomach. That is the genius of Joaquin Phoenix where he completely immerses himself in this character and unleashes the madness that the Joker is supposed to have. Todd Phillip's as the director brings out a refreshing take on the Joker's character and storyline. Robert De Niro in his small but limited role as always makes an impact. The only flaw that I felt that was that movie was a tad slow and I expected more action sequences. But I guess that was just me. Maybe that was required for the built up to show all the craziness that Joker does.

      "title": " An absolute masterpiece. Critics are offended by this movie and here's why....",
      "review": "I will start off by saying I had very high hopes for this movie, but was not expecting it to live up to the hype. Neither was I expecting Joaquin Phoenix to even get close to measuring up to Heath Ledger's Dark Knight performance. I will admit I am a huge fanboy of Ledger, so when I say that Phoenix blew me away and gave an equally amazing performance in this film and that this movie is probably the best movie made during this decade, I absolutely mean that.This movie is more than just an origin story. It's an in depth view of how someone becomes a villain and the factors that lead to it. To start off, yes, Arthur Fleck, aka the Joker, is mentally unstable and suffers a condition that forces him to laugh in situations he shouldn't laugh in. Mix this with his anxiety, he is put in positions that are extremely uncomfortable that he doesn't want to be in. It also doesn't help that his social worker doesn't listen to him and is disgruntled by the fact that the government she works for doesn't value her profession enough to keep it alive. Arthur Fleck is a good person at heart in the beginning and is trying his absolute best to be happy and make people happy. But as the movie goes on, his attempts to do everything in his power are crushed, and ultimately, he hits a breaking point, leading the Joker to become a psychotic murderer.This above mentioned point is why I think critics and the media are quick to dismiss this movie, because it does not fit the \"guns and weapons\" are the problem narrative. If you look at any tragedy that happens, what get blamed? The weapon, or ideology in 99% of the cases. The media does this because it advances an agenda that they align themselves with. Heaven forbid the people committed the crime was actually just mentally ill and just looking for validation for their actions. Or better yet, will get recognition and fame from, you guessed it, the media.Now, where does the Joker fit in to the above mentioned point? Why I loved this movie so much is that the Joker sees validation for his actions. At first, the first murder is shocking, he's scared, and honestly the first murders could be justified as self defense. But as the media portray's the support he receives, he starts to think that what he is doing is ok, and ultimately there are some people that view him as a hero. Why, because the media allowed this happen and society validated it by supporting him.Aside from this point, the movie itself is phenomenally done. This is hands down the best origin story to have been made. It's brutally honest, it's dark, it's violent, and very uncomfortable at times. Phoenix's performance is the best I've ever seen him do. He deserves the Oscar, and quite honestly this movie deserves best picture. But it probably won't win it because it doesn't 1) Say everyone that is white is a racist or 2) Have a liberal agenda. or 3) Say guns are the reason for mass shootings, 4) Say's \"Orange man bad\".Critics are out of touch, and honestly are an invalid profession. Critic is another word for \"someone who gets paid to share an opinion.\" At the time of this review, the movie has a 9.0/10 rating from ~150K users, with a metascore of 58 from less than 100. Listen to the masses instead of the \"Elite\" who claim to know better than you. This movie is worth the viewing."

      "review": "An intense buildup of a mentally broken character, slowly mutating, from the environment that surrounds him and from himself, into the world's famous Joker. This movie is not for everyone, its a carefully crafted piece of art both shocking and slow to unveil, which many may not like. However, these two parts really make the movie. The slowness gives you an appreciation for the impeccable and subtle characterization by Joaquin and connects you in a better way to the pain and suffering of Arthur, the character. Its shocking nature allows for a constant back and forth between sympathizing with his struggles and repulsing his actions, while at the same time, understanding the stance he ultimately finds himself in. Everything pieced together with great music, sound, ambient, and acting. Special congratulations to Joaquin Phoenix who steals the show, as it should be. He created a very intriguing character that while connected with the Joker persona, doesn't resemble any of the character's previous interpretations, therefore making this his unique and personal take."

      "review": "I really dont know what to say about this movie, it was a masterpiece. Joaquin Phoenix absolutely deserves an oscar, every single scene was perfect, his laugh was CRAZY, the fact that he lost 52 pounds (23 kilograms) for this role is just unbelievable. The music tells you what Arthur is feeling inside of him, he's mad, he's angry, he's bored, he's depressed, he's sad, he wants to kill everyone, it just gives you chills, hats off to Hildur Guðnadóttir. The movie isn't just about a guy who turns into THE JOKER because of society, No, it tells you the truth of the world that we live in nowadays and the truth of our society. The movie is so dark exactly like it should be and exactly like we all wanted it to be. The script is perfect and written in a very smart way. The thing that i didnt like about the movie is that we didnt see Robert De Niro and Zazie Beetz that much, and makes sense cause the movie is about ARTHUR FLICK but i really wanted more of Robert De Niro, also the movie didnt show us the relationship and the romance side between Arthur Flick and Sophie Dumond they just talked in the elevator and he was imaging stuff in his head like he kissed her and they went out together and thats it. Makeup was amazing and accurate, really loved it. Also really loved the ending that was unexpected (when you see the trailer) but then when you watch the movie you know that he is going to kill Murray (Robert De Niro) because he had the gun with him and then we were all sitting on the edge of our seats, and we were all nervous about it and then when he shot him it was just so shocking. The movie is so deep and the ending is still unknown, at the end when Aurther was laughing and told the psychiatrist \"i just thought of something funny, \"but you wouldnt get it\" then a flashback to Bruce Wayne on the crime alley with his parents dead in the ground and I found it wierd why would Arthur find this funny? There are many questions on this movie and that's what makes it a great movie. Hats off to all the cast and crew and to Todd Philips for giving us that masterpiece."

Everything that makes him happy seems to be an illusion, so we do not know he was really saved in the ending or he reached asylum that very night. But it is a pure reality that all murders were real. So yes he is The Joker or he is the role model of the real Joker. The most interesting part was the connection of Thomas and his wife's murder with Arthur's story.

And it's harrowing in its grittiness and potential. You will be there in the streets of Gotham, a Gotham that feels more real than any other fictional city on screen. Because little does it matter where the events happen on screen. This Joker can be anyone, anywhere.A perfect score in movie means more than just a great story. For me it means the character, the performance, the build-up. And all of them are beautifully done. Especially the build-up. Maybe some will think it's too slow, but I was glued to the screen the whole time.Of course, I still have some complaints, but most of them are because of my view on the Joker. As the classic Joker, I think Heath Ledger is still the best but he was helped by the script. The Joker's background should not be known, that's what makes the character so unpredictable.But Joaquin Phoenix's Joker is the people's hero, a deranged hero for a deranged society."

      "title": " Phoenix Delivers An Oscar Winning Performance",
      "review": "Was completely mesmerized by Phoenix's performance in this film. Absolutely astounding, he had me eating out of the palm of his hand. He boldly emoted every nuance of the central character, using a very Method technique. Physically, he obviously lost a great deal of weight. His face is all sharp angles and eyes, perfect for his many close ups. His body looks lithe, nearly skeletal, which is showcased in scenes of him bent, writhing, and dancing. The costuming makes great use of Phoenix's height and weight, clothing him in tight, tall lines and going from ragged, dreary everyday thrift shop clothing to the eventual final appearance in the Joker's familiar suited attire, in it's garish colors of blood and dirt.Phoenix speaks perhaps 15 minutes of full dialogue in this performance, but he uses his face, his entire body, to communicate to the audience every moment of his character's state of mind. The audience is captivated as he shows us, not tells us, exactly what Arthur is experiencing. His is a bleak tale of madness and woe. Arthur's alter-ego, the Joker, embodies his incarnation as 'The Lord of Chaos', spinning deeper and deeper into insanity and anarchy with the audience held captive. Until we, like Arthur, aren't sure what is real and what is fantasy anymore.I'm totally perplexed as to media reviews that are concerned that the public may be somehow compelled to violence as a result of this film. No sane person will be compelled to rise in anarchy against the rich or against the government because they see Joker. Joker states in the film by reason of explanation, that he does what he does out of DESPAIR against humanity's capabilities to be mean to one another. He just wants everyone to get along. \"Why can't you just be...NICE?!\" The story of this film, as I saw it, was the story of how one person succumbs to insanity finally, after a life of horrific abuse and abject poverty. Yes, I felt bad for the character. Do I condone the violence that the Joker perpetuates in the film because of his circumstances? No, I didn't. No reasonably sane person will either. All it will take is one nutjob stating he committed some terrible act, for this film to be wrongfully attributed to causing mayhem and be dismissed entirely wrongfully from the Oscar picks it deserves: Best Director, Best Actor, Best Sound, Best Cinematography."

Cinematography is nostalgic, beautiful, with a perfect sense of desperation and rebirth. Some parts (like the date part) try a bit too hard. The change of mindset is painful but gradual and convincing.And regarding its story, it feels weirdly realistic watching JOKER in NYC. I've seen the filthy streets in the shadow of the vibrant theaters. I've seen the homeless crying laughing on the train, while the suits standing on the other side. During the blackout, I saw people standing on Fifth Avenue, hopelessly waiting for the never-coming bus while some others driving home in Ferrari.

      "review": "There is a surprisingly high number of critics calling this movie empty and meaningless. I believe they are having a difficult time differentiating between the film being void of substance and their own feelings of emptiness. Joker indeed left a pit in my stomach. The kind you get when you witness something traumatizing. And this film is traumatic in the best way.The intricate camera work is almost too close for comfort. But man, is this a beautiful looking movie. The colors are rich... the reds of the streetlights, the blue haze of the city.... creates an atmosphere that puts the viewer right into this world. The wide shots of Gotham are absolutely stunning, even as it's showing us the dirty, grimy nastiness of it.The story Todd and the filmmakers came up with works pretty well. They borrow bits and pieces of material from the comics, but they created new beats for the story that helps it stand on its own. Not to spoil anything, but the way they introduce the lore of our characters heroic counterpart is quite affective. At first I thought it was far reaching, but by the end it comes together and makes for quite an engaging story. As for the motivations of the Joker, there is a complicated tight rope to balance. But it is understandable here. We can understand Arthur is spiraling and we can sympathize with his internal (and external) struggle. But the film is not asking you to root for or forgive him for his actions. We know he's a villain.The violence... it's there. But not in quantity. Most other superhero films or action films have more fighting, violence, and more of A body count. HOWEVER, the violence is brutal and visceral. This is what I believe is bothering people. As it should. It depicts violence in a horrifying realistic way.So Joaquin Phoenix... I don't know what to really say here. He is an artist. A mad one. I respect this actor so much, and I am in complete awe of him. This man sold this. I believed it. Everything from the physical to the internal. His movements were slightly unnatural, inhuman. Behind his eyes was a pain that we recognize is there, but there is no way we can fathom the gravity behind it. his moments of emotional outbursts are so sporadic and unpredictable.... and he isn't TRYING to have them.... I could tell he was surpassed that and was trying to hold it back. That is completely amazing to me. He isnt acting he is showing us this character, like a piece of art. No one, NO ONE can deny that this performance is extraordinary. It's one that will be remembered in the future as one of the best in history. It transcends a normal performance. It's visceral, it's terrifying, it's an experience to watch. Joaquin Phoenix is an actor in the true sense. He is, in my opinion, one of the best... in history.This is a difficult film, it's not lighthearted at all. It's a shame if you miss this though, as it's a work of art. I would recommend it as a great film, but be cautious of the blunt nasty darkness of it. It is truly a horrific masterpiece."

I don't understand that at all, those people to me only wanted an action movie as they apparently didn't have the intelligence to understand a psychological thriller like this. As I stated, this wasn't trying to be an action movie, it wanted to show the Jokers transformation from harmless crazy guy down the street to full on psychotic criminal kingpin. I don't think this is really a major spoiler, but I loved how we were able to see young Bruce Wayne's story unfold in the background as well! I told my sister when we talked about a sequel that if she wanted to know what happens next, go straight to Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight, then you'll be able to watch two brilliant performances in a row as the Joker, (You were awesome, too, Bale, but this is about the Joker- lol). and basically see the whole story of his life in those two movies. But, that's not to say I'm not onboard with a Joker sequel! I think this is in the running, if not the front runner, for my best movie if the year, but I'll have to sit down and have a look at all the others I've seen! Awesome flick!"

      "review": "I needed a couple of days to thinks this over because this is an incredibly complex film. Personally I think this is one of the best films ever. The narrative is complex yet impactful to the point where; whether you agreed with it or not, you have to admit that it hits you right in the face and ignites something in your head. I feel like emotions will be touched by the film because it is just so good at portraying everything they wished to put on the screen. It tackles very complicated issues and it is so good in entangling every important issue that is needed to be voiced out and they do it in a way that nothing is belittled or taken for granted and that the intended messaged is conveyed clearly without sacrificing its mystic. If nothing else this movie looks amazing. The tone of it is gritty and dark and can be seen in the cinematography but they do it in a way that looks absolutely gorgeous. Furthermore, don't get me started with Joaquin Pheonix's portrayal, it is horrifyingly good. He's movements, line delivery and all-around commitment to the role is beyond Oscar-worthy. You feel everything he's feeling and the way he presents himself on the screen is just jaw-droppingly amazing. Lastly one of my favorite things in the movie was the score. The score, soundtrack and sound design is fantastic, it is incredibly fun to listen too.All in all, I absolutely love this film. It is just right up my alley and personally I truly can't find anything wrong with it. I do understand why this controversial because this will not cater to all audiences. The narrative is unorthodox and there will be certain types of people that will be offended, they won't agree with it and just downright hate it. To me though if nothing else, the film will open deep conversations which is something that only a handful of movies have been able to do.

He gets poor reviews, however he definitely has better delivery and material than say Russel Howard. Ultimately he aspires to get a spot on Late Night, hosted by De Nero in a return to form Jay Leno/David Letterman role.This is a hyper real take on the Joker, where the backdrop is Gotham, but it could be anywhere - following a serial murderer.

      "review": "You will likely leave Joker feeling like I did: unsettled and ready to debate the movie for years to come.Joker demands multiple viewings, one of Joker's strengths is that anyone will be able to argue their side about what was real and what was imagined, and no one will be able to say another's read of it is inaccurate. For a movie about one of fiction's most unreliable narrators, we should expect nothing less.It offers no easy answers to the unsettling questions it raises about a cruel society in decline. Joaquin Phoenix's fully committed performance and Todd Phillips' masterful albeit loose reinvention of the DC source material make Joker a film that should leave comic book fans and non-fans alike disturbed and moved in all the right ways.Drawing its spirit and style from classic '70s and '80s films like Taxi Driver, The King of Comedy, A Clockwork Orange, and Dog Day Afternoon, it presents Gotham City that is unmistakably a stand-in for the hellish New York City of the era. It was a time when rampant crime, corruption, economic crises, and social ills saw it dubbed \"Fear City\".Unnervingly played by Joaquin Phoenix, the mentally ill Arthur Fleck is a struggling, overlooked schlepp trapped on the margins of society. Arthur is a man who has never had a good break or happy day in his life. The less said about how and why Arthur embraces the Joker persona and finds his liberation and joyful empowerment the better - this is a film meant to be experienced with an open mind and sans spoilers - but suffice it to say this Joker is the end result of a society far too comfortable with its casual cruelties and lack of empathy. We create the monsters we deserve. Arthur's increasingly unstable mental state is reflected in the film as things grow progressively more surreal, nightmarish, and violent in the homestretch."

You watch his slow decent into madness and you're clenching onto your seat to see what he might do next; whether that is killing ruthlessly, or creating fake relationships in his twisted mind. Joaquin Phoenix depicts the perfect battle between good and evil with his constant struggle between happiness and sadness. In the end I was honestly routing for the joker because of the pain manifested through his whole life. This movie made me laugh, cry, and made me see things differently about society.

      "title": " A Fantastic and Unnerving Character Study",
      "review": "Films based on comic books have been the craze over the last decade or so, to say the least. From Iron Man launching a franchise bigger than any interconnected cinematic franchise in history to The Dark Knight being known as one of the best films of all time, we're currently living in the golden age of comic book adaptations, so it should come as no surprise that a few unexpected outings would be attempted as well. Joker has now hit theatres and while I can say right off the top that it won't be for all moviegoers, this is a fantastic piece of storytelling.Being alone his entire life and thrown to the side by society, Arthur Fleck still lives with his mother well into adulthood and has a full-time job as a street clown. Having a condition that causes him to uncontrollably laugh, this character study is engaging from start to finish. Slowly realizing the truth about his life, things begin to devolve into chaos in his mind. Joker is simply a study of the mind of someone who has nothing left to live for or be happy about. For this reason alone, this is going to be a tough watch for certain viewers. Having a homicidal maniac as your core focus is not exactly an easy sell.Now, Joker shares quite a few similarities to other classic films, which is being criticized a lot throughout many reviews, but I didn't see that as a negative. There are so many formulas that have been emulated to create great works of fiction that calling this movie a rip-off would be an insult to the filmmakers. On top of that, this movie is held together by a performance by Joaquin Phoenix that's truly out of this world, so any minor issues I had were usually overshadowed by him.Phoenix's portrayal of this character, like every actor who has played this character in the past, is extremely committed, whether or not you like the outcome. Thankfully, I think his portrayal is completely different from anyone who came before him, making this movie one that will be able to stand on its own for a long time. From his quirks when the film begins to where he ends up during the final act, each and every moment was riveting.In the end, Joker does borrow a little too much from classic to really call it a masterpiece or perfect, but it's pretty close in my opinion, in terms of holding your interest for an unlikely anti-hero. It's directed very, very well by Todd Phillips and I was more than happy to see him evolve as a filmmaker here. This is something that I never thought I would see him do and, aside from the level of great comedy in a movie like The Hangover, this is probably his best work to date. I loved nearly everything about this movie, even though it will upset some viewers and make them feel very uncomfortable. In fact, for that reason alone, it has done its job very well. You're not supposed to root for him, but rather understand where his actions come from. This is a great film."

      "review": "While the acting and the actual movie was great in it's own right, this was not the Joker, not even close. The joker is not a weak person, nor is he dumb or a coward, which he is in this film. He's got a knack to feel human weaknesses an act upon it. This Joker was a poor little thing you want to pity. Unable to defend himself (You're kidding right??) full of self pity, in short a looser. Well, sorry to say, but that's a different Joker altogether, if Todd Philips wanted to make a movie about mental illness, why did he pick a Marvel character? But most of all, the previous Joker characters were funny, unhinged, but funny. Heath Ledger was amazing because he could be funny and chilling at the same time (My father came at me with a knife, looked at me « why so seeeeerious..... ») . Joachim Phoenix character was so boring and lame, he did not have a single redeeming action, you never feel him in charge in the whole movie. And that's tragic for this character, please Mr Phillips, leave those characters alone and create your own."

Consequently you cannot help yourself but to sympathize with the villain.The only less convincing part is the studio scene after he admits a murder. If a guy dressed in a clown tells me he shot three people I as a talk show host would either not believe him or - if I believed him - immediately call for security and not continue talking with him. But appart from that small detail - a must watch movie."

How can it score lesser than a \"trashy\" movie like Last Jedi?Are the critics the only ones with the brains or artistic appreciation to rate movies?

Over the years we have gotten full fledged jokers never an origin where we actually get to see why he became joker. I'm really glad mr phillips took up the mantle in doing this film because we really needed a change from the campy, over the top, predictable, cheesy and kid friendly cbm's we've been getting esp. from marvel. You do have people out there who are interested in serious contents that challenges one's belief. This movie isn't glorifying killing or incels it shows you how society can help shape disenfranchise individuals. The fact that critics are outraged over this, has led me to be believe the director has achieved his motive(by creating a thought provoking film). The critics are proving todd's and joker's point about society. This is top tier movie and DEFINITELY one of the best movies ever made esp. in the 21st century. The best movie of the year.....It's right up there with Dark Knight if not better."

The most powerful moment has to be the blood smile. Symbolising the death of Arthur and rise of the Joker. The score as it's happening is just so riveting. His laugh has more meaning than ever, a fantastic new take on the Joker's laugh, where it's seen as a mentally ill thing. I love Joker because of how different it is compared to the majority of Comic Book Movies. Dark, not much humour (I don't really humour mind being in CBM) It's just so different from Marvel because of how repetitive they are. Todd Phillips, thank you for bringing my favourite character back to life again. Phoenix better win an Oscar. He absolutely deserves this."

Director Todd Phillips take on the Joker was as good as it was due to Jauquin Phoenix's incredible take on such a storied character. To me, this movie was a much more modern and \"real\" take on how Aurther Fleck became the joker. Make no mistake, this is not a polished DC style movie with CGI and crazy effects. This is a gritty, dark drama that explores a man who feels alone, as if society has forgotten about him all together. His response is something the viewer can understand and even empathize with to some degree. The focus on mental health brings a move like this home and makes it feel far more down to earth than any other super hero movie. The different perspective on Thomas Wayne, Alfred, and other key characters in the Batman story provide an interesting counter point to the perfect benevolent super hero's were used to seeing.I can't seem to understand the negative reviews for this movie as this was easily one of the better movies I've seen this year."

I often found myself empathizing with the pain Phoenix placed inside of the character. And I could almost never anticipate what he was going to do next.

And the Political message is not that good, only if the answer you are looking for ia TOTAL BRAINLESS ANARCHY... Not trying to take the merits of the movie, the acting is quite good, the directing is ok, it is a dark movie with a good Gotham thirties vybe set up, the narrative is well writen, but the soundtrack is just to depressing. I cant even say what type of movie this is, but Phoenix says in the movie a thing that sums it up: All this time i tought my life was a tragedy, but in the end it is a comedy! I mean you kind of fell sorry for the joker, but in the end he just got what he deserved. You expect something diferent in the movie, that happens something for the movie to take off, but the self misery never ends. Well the ending is ok, with a small easter egg. But it is the truth, you could have made a movie with a regular guy who was not the JOKER, and this movie just wouldnt be as overhyped as it is, and people wouldnt like it as much. It would be a simple movie, with a maniac phicopath who lives with is mom, and as to take meds because he as a laughing condition. And then he starts to kill people because he is angry about is life being miserable, tired of being mistreated, and also beacause he is sorry about himself. Joaquim Phoenix does a good job, so does Robert de Niro, but this is never a Oscar winning performance as peolple say. I have seen millions of better performances. And Heath Ledger Joker is a lot better. What angrys me the most is if this is a origin story for the Villain joker, it is a bad one... Since with this sorry guy, he would never become the dangerous arch-enemy of bruce wayne because simply this guy is a complete idiot, as no brains, is actions are predictible, and he acts on the momment without thinking in consequences. The JOKER was a very clever enemy, sinister and pure evil, not this sick man... Well comparing this to taxi driver, ia a complete joke. The only thing in commom is that Robert the Nire participates in both movies. Taxi driver, as a downward spiral man as well, but it makes a lot more sense and it is a lot better. P.S: A advice, see this movie at home, in the movie theater it is a letdown movie, because the movie drags a lot and you will think why you did not stay at home. Hey i wasnt expecting a action movie, but i expecting a good thriller and clearly this is not. I guess the Joker was on me :)"

Joaquin Phoenix's performance ably shows that outward circumstances created Batman's number one foe. He then becomes a more sympathetic character, even though he is gradually morphing into a monster. The shooting of the three bankers comes at a pint when all the bad things that have happened to Fleck psychologically overwhelm him. From then on, all the people who have heaped misery onto his state of mind become the vat of chemicals that physically turned him into Joker. Near the end of the movie, Todd Phillips cleverly has Fleck's final murderous act becomes the catalyst for Bruce Wayne's parents to be murdered. Though it's a standalone film, this ending sets things up for the reboot of the Batman film franchise, in spite of that not being Phillips' intention.

      "review": "Quentin, I love what you have done here. This script sings a love for Hollywood that leaps off the page. I like that you're changing history again and I think that this mixed genre thing you've got going on could work really well.I do have some issues however.One of the things I look forward to in your screenplays are the hidden coincidental connections and clever foreshadowing of events to come. e.g - \"Garcon coffee!\" or \"Pai Mei taught you the five point palm exploding heart technique?\"I know you really wanted to do 'a day in the life' of these characters, but the lack of connections between these stories makes for some uninteresting set-ups that never quite pay off.1. Steve McQueen sets up the relationship between Jay Sebring and Roman Polanski, but we never see or hear from him again.2. Bruce Lee and Cliff Booth fight, but we don't get a resolution?3. If the Manson Family gets killed before they murder anyone, Charles Manson will never be implicated in the murder and he will still be out there.4. Jay Sebring is clearly trying to get back with Sharon and Roman is cool with him hanging around all the time?5. The Western TV show with Rick was cool, but he goes and acts in a Sergio Corbucci film we never see?Now, I'm no Oscar winning writer, so take this with a grain of pepper...What if you scrap the TV Western scene and convert it to a sequence in Italy showing Rick working with Sergio Corbucci on Nebraska Jim. Nebraska Jim is a success and when Rick comes back on a high, he finds an invite in the mail to Sharon Tate's party.Rick and Cliff Booth head to the party, and as they walk up to the gate, Bruce Lee and Steve McQueen pull up in a red Ferrari (I am sure you know this, but they were good friends in real life. Bruce was his trainer and Steve was an accomplished martial artist). Bruce and Cliff have words before they speed off up the driveway and into the party.At the party Jay Sebring spots Rick and they have that interaction you wrote at the end where they talk about his body of work, showing Jays appreciation for Rick as an actor. Sharing their mutual love of pop culture, Cliff, Rick and Jay become friends and make some drinks together.Steve McQueen and Bruce Lee chat to Sharon Tate when Roman Polanski comes bursting in pissed at Jay for trying to steal his pregnant wife.Outside the Manson family members (Tex, Pussy, Sadie, Patricia and Linda Kasabian) pull up with Charlie in the driver's seat. They all smoke acid dipped cigarettes (except Charlie, who pretends to).Charlie runs them through his plan once again, making sure everyone knows what they have to do. They get out of the car and Linda Kasabian has second thoughts. She makes a run for it, leaving them with a part of the plan missing - Charlie now has to go in with them.Jay and Roman are about to get physical. Rick and Cliff stand on the side of Jay, and Steve and Bruce side with Roman.It's about to get nasty when Sharon's stands in the middle trying to break them apart. They start to fight, Sharon's water breaks and she goes into labor.BANG! A gun fires in the air and five Manson family members (Including Charlie - who is holding the gun) walk into the party.Charlie gives one of your famous monologues about his distaste for the entertainment industry, and the Mexican stand-off begins.In an awesome Kill-Bill-esk kung fu fight, Bruce, Steve, Rick and Cliff take down all the Manson family members.Only Charlie remains. He's had the gun the whole time, but has shown his true colors and been too afraid to use it.Bruce, Rick, Cliff and Steve all begin to converge on Charlie. He who knows he's done for, so he turns the gun on himself and pulls the trigger - CLICK! he's out of bullets.In a Death-Proof-esk ending, Cliff, Rick, Bruce and Steve take him to pieces.Sharon gives birth, and Roman and Jay make up.In a post credits scene (because they're all the rage these days) we see Rick, Cliff, Steve and Bruce working together on Game of Death - The movie Bruce Lee never finished.Just a suggestion.Hope it goes well for you.Peace."

Very Good \"Acting\" from the leads but the child star may have stole the show, granted it was technically a tie between her and the Brad Pitt's Pit bull terrier, but the dog won as it had more purpose.Walked out of the movie after before the ninety minute mark as I was thoroughly bored.Reminds me of that scene from Planes, Trains and Automobiles, where Steve Martin talks about John Candy's anecdotes,\" Honey I'd like you to meet Del Griffith. He's got some amusing anecdotes. Here's a gun so you can blow your brains out. You'll thank me for it.\" \"I could tolerate any insurance seminar, for days I could sit there and listen to them going on and on with a big smile on my face\"-\"How can you stand it?\"\"Because I've been with Del Griffith\" When you're telling a story, have a point. It makes it so much interesting for the listener.Now I truly know how Steve Martin's character felt.Tarantino was obviously messing with the audience by having us watch the making of the Western Show (pretending to be meta and all that guff).Uninteresting anecdotes. Check. Unfinished or events of non closure told in flashbacks to ransom the audience. Check. Unnecessary scenes. (Party in the playboy mansion (sans nudite), buying an expensive first edition of a book, repairing a tv aerial) Check. Glorification of smoking. Check. Foot/Shoe fetishism. Check. Watching scenes from older movies in a movie \"The Wrecking Crew\" as a vain effort to be meta or break the fourth wall. Check.Undoubtedly, I am sure that all the Tarantino fans/sycophants will of course down-vote this review. Regrettably I am not in the habit of drinking the cool-aid so to speak.Hope that Jerry Seinfeld sues him for ripping off his idea of comedians in car getting coffee. Minus the coffee, comedy and any significant dialogue. I've heard and engaged in better conversations whilst in a dentist's chair.Dull, pointless and disrespecting Bruce Lee was very uncool and unnecessary on so many levels.Thank goodness it is his last film.Pity that he could have retired a lot sooner."

      "review": "The ninth film by Quentin Tarantino is immensely entertaining, but that has come to be expected of the incredible director/writer. Many scenes have legitimate humor in them without feeling forced, something many modern movies fail to do. This homage to an amazing era in Hollywood works because Tarantino understands the material. It is obvious that he enjoyed making this film as much as we enjoy watching it! The other biggest strength this film has is it's three leads, Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, and Margot Robbie. Rick (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Cliff (Brad Pitt) bounce off of each other so well as characters and there's nothing to dislike about the lovely Margot Robbie's performance as well. It will be interesting to see if this film stands the test of time, but if I was a betting man I'd put my money on it for sure!"

There is no denying Brad Or Leonardo's acting prowess and that is what gets the stars. Interesting to see Brad looking younger than Leo as each day goes by !The film didn't seems to know what story it was telling with the resulting mess that the story arc was flimsy at the most. The build up wasn't the right build up to the climax, which itself was more of a whimper than a climax (no matter how much you try and pad out with some QT violence). Margot Robbie's character could have been played by anyone with hardly any lines or real acting to do. Had any other writer or director pitched this film, it wouldn't have got any big stars and probably wouldn't have been funded - fortunately for the money men, they were guaranteed a return based on it being QT.the whole point of the film could have been done smartly in a 30 minute short story film.Very very disappointing and a real case of style of substance....."

The movie also has an identity crisis, it really doesn't know what it wants to be. It's riddled with inconsistent choices, at first it puts the names of the supposed celebreties on screen, then it stops. It wastes a long time on the shooting of Rick's western, but then it's a voice over by Cliff about his 3 films in Italy in 5 minutes. And I kid you not, the whole theater was laughing at the supposed violence at the end of the movie, I felt embarassed and ashamed. And why on earth waste Margot Robbie's time and talent just to be irrelevant at the end?I tell you one thing at the end, if it wasn't Tarantino's name on the script I swear it wouldn't have been picked up ti be made as a movie."

      "title": " Best of 2019 so far",
      "review": "The 9th film by Quentin Tarantino Once upon a time in Hollywood seems to be Tarantino's most mature, laid back and easy going film. And I mean maturity as in the maturity of Tarantino as a filmmaker. This is very different than every other film of his, it doesn't rely on shock value (until the end anyway), it doesn't have super hardcore violence for the most part, it also doesn't have high tension sequences that we've come to expect from Tarantino, but that's doesn't disappoint you because that high tension galore isn't needed here. It's a comedy about two friends. A fading actor and his stuntman in the aftermath of the golden age of cinema, trying to fit in, in a rapidly changing industry. What I love about this is Tarantino's love for filmmaking, films and the experience of going to the cinema is oozing in this. You can just tell he LOVES what he does and he LOVES going to the movies. The \"quirky\" kind of tone, the witty, fantastic dialogue is all still there and it is top tier Tarantino. The performances from Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio are incredible, such great chemistry, they elevate the film in every scene they are together, Margot Robbie plays Sharon Tate beautifully. And she did a great job respectfully portraying an actress who was murdered tragically. My biggest gripe with the film is that Tarantino didn't use any of his signature high tension, downright uncomfortable sequences regarding the Manson cult. I would've liked to experiences that eeriness when he introduced us to the cult in the film, but he just brushed it off. Other than that the film is incredible artistic, stylized; the soundtrack is amazing, it works incredible well while cliff booth is driving around the night time in LA. It sets the mood perfectly. This is also gonna be one of, if not THE most rewatchable film Tarantino has ever made. Just great. I loved it so much, and I suspect I'll love it even more as time goes on. It's incredible Tarantino made a film with almost no structured narrative and you still come out of it thinking \"that was fantastic\" ; the last shot of the film is so beautiful, and kind of sad if you read up on the Sharon Tate murder. I loved Tarantino's twist to what happened, it made me wish that only if that had what happened in real life :("

      "title": " Tarantino's La La Land",
      "review": "Quentin Tarantino loves cinema, there is absolutely no denying that. With that being said, there was probably no one better suited to making a film such as Once Upon a Time in Hollywood than him, with its sun-soaked framing of Los Angeles and array of colourful characters serving as an ode to the Golden Age of Hollywood.It's 1969 and faded Hollywood actor Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio), along with his stunt double Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt), find themselves struggling to find fame and stay relevant amidst the end of Hollywood's Golden Age.Plenty has been made of the narrative choices and how prominent a role Margot Robbie has to play in the film prior to its release but I feel these people have missed the idea of the film and just need something to post about to keep hits coming on their sites. Tarantino has made a love letter to an era of Hollywood that majorly inspired him, and Robbie's role, as with others throughout the film, have a small part to play in a much bigger tapestry. More on that later though.The main focus here is Dalton and Booth, both on their friendship and their desire to keep working amidst an ever-changing Hollywood landscape. It feels a little restrained for a Tarantino film however, that only makes it a more interesting and personal piece of work from the eccentric filmmaker. Because of that, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood becomes one of his most emotional films to date, the journey Dalton goes on in particular driving the film forward to one hell of a finale, bringing the violence you'd expect in a Tarantino film.The restraint shown in places doesn't mean this doesn't feel like a Tarantino film at all, the exquisite cinematography from Robert Richardson sweeping between Hollywood sets and lavish lifestyles. There is of course intricate details in the production design that Tarantino just wouldn't make a film without, as with the costume designs, and the choice of music for the soundtrack is so on-point that Hollywood in the late 60s really is brought to life in fantastic fashion.Coming to the performances, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is led by two great performances from two accomplished actors in Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt. There's a number of scenes where the two just hang out together and, thanks to their dynamic chemistry and well-written dialogue, I could have spent hours on end in their company. DiCaprio is utterly brilliant in the role of Dalton, a man so scared of being forgotten and left behind, while Pitt shines as Booth, both men having worked with Tarantino before so effectively.There's a whole host of supporting characters and cameos throughout, some coming in anecdotal flashbacks, that some may see as over-indulgence from Tarantino but I felt it kept the ball rolling on quite a long film. Margot Robbie has the most prominent appearance of all the supporting characters and, while her Sharon Tate is used very sparingly, Robbie certainly makes a lasting impression, her undeniable screen presence lighting up the film.It's by no means his best film however, Quentin Tarantino has made another film in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood that will be regarded as a classic in the years to come. Some have said it's far too long for the story it's trying to tell but I'd happily spend more time in this world with these characters."

This movie is a Bible for every lovers of the seventh art, for the others, it will allows them to discover a lot of things about the atmosphere of the 60-70s. As always Dicaprio and Pitt prove that they are two of the bests actors nowadays. Margot Robbie appears like a shooting star, she doesn't play in a lot of scenes but everytime we see her she is gorgeous and her charisma allows her to shine more than any other actor in the movie. For the Tarantino lovers, they will find a lot of his style all along the movie but especially at the end. I heard a lot of critics talking about this movie and they all say that for a lot of people this movie will be weird. However, all my friend loved it and I thing that 90% of my friends are not moviegoers. I will finish this review by saying that as always the music if awesome !!!

      "review": "All this critical acclaim for this film (mainly because it's a Tarantino one) is so baffling. So what's wrong with it? For a start nothing actually happens throughout until the last 10 minutes. It's a slow, turgid, self congratulatory affair with drawn out scenes and tons of tips of the cap to the 'era' - through the soundtrack and product placement of 1960s packaging, or 'real life' characters like Sam Wannamaker's appearance - that just aren't needed. They even splice Di Caprio into the Great Escape as a 'what if?' moment...but all for what? Just Hollywood slapping itself on the back again about being Hollywood.There were genuine tense moments like when Pitt's character visits the Manson family allotment that turn into a damp squib. Again why was that scene so long? Why did they spend so much time on Di Caprio playing the baddy in the western but no time at all on his character's move to Italy (apart from the fact Tarantino wanted to imagine what 1960s spaghetti western posters would've looked like with DiC in them!). And what was the point of Al Pacino? Or Sharon Tate's character for that matter once you see the ending....?This was a missed opportunity that could've been a great piece on an actor's dwindling career that just turned into a boring series of sort of linked scenes...albeit quite well acted ones. Tarantino is become the new Woody Allen...actors want one of his films on their resume despite the fact he hasn't made a good one in so long"

It's a joke on the society we currently live in, with glorifying reviews from people who obviously couldn't tell the difference between quality and pulp. People who give this a ten star review but indicate they were bored with the movie. As a culture, we have reached a total dead end here.The film glaringly lacks the most basic feats that make any film passable - pure amateur hour- yet scores an 8 on this website, as I write this.Either people are as dumb as they come and are completely out of tune with reality, or 90% of these 10 star reviews were created by bots.Whatever it is, the joke's on all of us.Just depressing, really.."

Until we get to the ratched-up ending which, although it certainly makes us sit up and take notice, I don't know to what end. Yeah, I wish that final episode had turned out your way too in August of 1969. But so what? It didn't. The switchup may be cathartic for Tarantino 50 years later (like the scalping in that other one), but it wasn't for me. Just didn't make me care about anybody or anything in this movie. And that's my era.Well, maybe the clips from the old TV shows got to me a little."

Nevertheless have I watched every Tarantino movie and honestly I love them all.I could not love OUATIH though. The last part was cool but nothing in comparison to other scenes from Tarantino ( except for the flamethrower scene that was badass). There were no surprises, no unlikely turns and no suspense. I missed the blood oh God did I miss the blood. The violence ... the exaggerated violence which defines tarantino for me. The plot was aimless. You could say so was Pulp Fiction's but the difference is this: every scene of every character was enjoyable.Acting was great especially Leo's of course and Brad as Cliff was amazing. Sharon Tate's portrayal was also really accurate but it did not improve the plot. It could have led the plot in a very great direction but yeah. The setting is beautiful and I really felt the 60's vibe.It could have been soooo much better. When I heard that it was about the Charles Mansons murders I had so many cool ideas how tarantino could make it awesome. But for my bad luck the first Tarantino movie I watched at the theaters is Tarantinos worst."

      "review": "1st, this was my first Alamo Drafthouse experience, opening night, which may skew my opinion because that was such a great viewing with the opening 30min vignette they added prior to showtime. This movie was really excellent. Like many of Tarantino's recent films, nothing happens until something happens at the very end, but like Seinfeld there is brilliance and masterful scripting during the meandering first 9/10ths of the film. I didn't think Brad Pitt could look cooler, but Tarantino made him the god that even heteros like me find ourselves attracted to like a cult leader or David Bowie. DiCaprio gives a brilliant performance as well as the washed up western star. The score may be one of the best in Tarantino's career which says a ton. The final tenth of the film is a feast of classic stunt gags pushed to the nth degree. This is a must see film. I wouldn't say it is Tarantino's best, but his worst (not sure which that one is... Kill Bill vol 2... maybe?) Is still better than most other movies. This is a step down from The Hateful 8 for me, but still thoroughly enjoying. I'll be watching it again without doubt."

Atmosphere and cinematography are amazing but the most important ingredient is missing; plot.It feels like they shot every mundane thing like going to a restaurant, feeding your dog, watching television, driving around, that adds nothing. Margot's role was totally out of place as well and the movie could hold itself without her and save 1 hour of random shots of her legs and her giggling in a cinema and some random dancing in every scene.There are just too many cringy and annoying parts in this movie.

The main/only strength of this film is to watch two fine actors giving it their all with great characters who are developed so well over an almost 3 hour period but apart from the occasional random scene, they're left to flicker and fade in an otherwise rambling journey that ultimately goes nowhere. QT has definitely toned down his stylised approach for this although it has som really nice touches when old classsics are revisited with a twist ;) But for a film with this little content to be almost 3 hours is just silly and pointless no matter how endearing it is to see Leo and Brad out in such great performances.

Teenagers won't get it. But this is a good movie for adult viewers, who have a hint of intellect. We live in a cruel world. Humans do terrible things to each other and in real life, it may be difficult to influence this. But I love how Tarantino takes a revenge on hateful humans in his latest movies. He goes 110% Tarantino on their asses - applying a pair of pliers and a blow torch:) Nazis, white supremacists, fanatics... they may be taking over the world, they may be getting in a way of normal people living their normal lives, but in this world of movies we can turn tables on them and we will, we will get medieval on their asses:) Thank you Quentin for this movie!"

I know I am not allowed to put spoilers into a review without first warning a potential reader, but there has to a plot that can be spoilt in the first place, and there isn't one. The film was a mess, from start to finish. A self indulgent mess. It has no continuity at all. OK Tarantino's films require a viewer to piece together a complex set of sub plots, that is the only reason I stayed in that cinema was in the hope I was going to slowly put the thing together and be amazed at the writers genius. Ha Ha, the only genius was my wife because she fell asleep after 20 minutes and awoke 2 hours later refreshed. The dog in the film was brilliant, it acted superbly. Pitt has moments that were good, DiCaprio - I could not make head or tail out of what he was supposed to be, or what film he was in, or what film I was watching.

I was really into it in parts (The ranch scene was fantastic) and I'm not sure how I'd have preferred for it to play out but I have to say it fell a little flat by the end, despite some quintessential Tarantino motifs. It's a peculiar style that Tarantino has chosen to tell his tale, and it's the first of his movies that I've watched where I had to remind myself this is a Tarantino film. Certainly there were plenty of his tell tale signs throughout, but for many passages it felt very unlike him; almost as though he was absent. There are small touches, like advertisements on street benches and radio chatter in cars, that bring you subtly into the era, in a way that only someone passionate about it could think of. He has recreated a part of history that I never knew; One that almost touches upon fascination before making me recoil. For so much of the first two thirds I swam in the mirage that Tarantino placed before me. Excitement filled me as the scenes jumped from one tangent to the next, the links never quite touching but close enough to keep me at ease. However, as story carried on, I began to get anxious. It was the blending of reality and fiction that I found most unsettling. Like water upon oil, they slide amongst each other to form pretty patterns but they never properly mix. And in the end, after almost three hours, I was left with a feeling of 'what was the point?'. Maybe that's Tarantino's goal. The '... in Hollywood' alludes to the phoniness of it all, and that if that's how Hollywood says it was, then that's how it is. The truth is secondary to a good story. And even though Hollywood does this in order to make the cinematic experience more satisfying for the viewer, in this case, it feels like I'm being lied to because they don't trust my ability to stomach the truth."

Tarantino criticizes the hippies community and their \"flower power\", he also lifted a middle finger for all the anti-smoking people, and ignored the car pollution, being one of the themes: \"the feeling of driving a car, while smoking a Red Apple and harassing every woman on the sidewalk.\" With a fast resolution, counterproductive and hard to finish, a fantastic soundtrack with a powerful production design, Tarantino open us a visual window for all this 60s generation, being \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" not a movie about a story lived in LA at the 60s, but a movie about LA in the 60s."

One actor is Sharon Tate (Robbie), she lives with the hottest director in town and her career is sparking.Next door is an actor by the name of Rick Dalton (DiCaprio). He used to be a lead on TV, but his career is heading downhill and he is beginning to feel it. His stunt double is also his best friend (Pitt), who has been pretty much blacklisted in Hollywood due to rumours about his personal life.The first hour 45 or so you are immersed in this world and follow the characters in their daily lives. The film takes a dark turn as Pitts character picks up a hitch hiker who happens to be one of the Manson Family and things escalate from there.As the title suggests, this is a fairytale, set in a particular time in Hollywood and the events of the movie enhance this. Real people intermix with fictional characters and it is all very interesting even after viewing to put together what was real and what was not.There has been criticism of the lack of lines for Margot Robbie from some female critics. They seem to feel Tarantino should have shoe horned in more lines to 'improve' his film and to fit their agenda. I'm tired of this rubbish.. thankfully Tarantino does not need to be bullied and stoop to pandering to these idiots and will make the film he wants to make.Sharon Tate is presented on screen as he envisioned. As a happy young woman, whose career is going the right way. In a stand out scene, she joins an audience in a cinema to watch one of her own films. This part (without lines, just her reaction) is one of the highlights of the film. What I also like about this sequence is that the real Sharon Tate is also on screen, acting in comedic moments and some kick ass moments showing the world she was more than just a victim of the Manson Family.Another stand out scene for me was DiCaprio after a long sequence filming a part in a TV Western series, then blows his lines. Its so awkward and is followed by a total meltdown in his trailer. He then goes back and nails the performance. A little girl tells him its the best acting she has ever seen, which makes him very emotional.When the Manson Family show up at Cielo Drive, your heart begins to sink a little, knowing what is to come.However, this is a fairy tale set in Hollywood and perhaps there is still appetite in this cynical world for a Hollywood ending."

Seriously Quentin, please stop with nicotine the itch never really goes away and this was more in your face absurd level of smoking than any movie made within the last couple of years. BTW, if you want to see a sequel to Pulp Fiction, watch Fargo Season 2. Every episode has a perfect 100 percent on RT, great music, characters, etc. Reminded me of Quentin circa Pulp Fiction."

      "review": "This movie was probably Tarantino's most genius work to date. As I said, this was the most historically inaccurate, but the most PERFECTLY executed COMEDY I've ever seen! Now here are the spoilers in bullet form...-Dicaprio and Pitt's characters are completely fiction.-Their adventures could have been easily seen as real due to how well written they were and if you don't know your history.-Bruce Lee was BEATEN by one of these fictional characters, but it seemed as if it could have happened!-The \"Charles Manson Family\" were FOILED in their insane plot to kill a certain woman (Sharon Tate) by one of these fictional characters.I only dock a point, due to some of the unnecessary vulgarity and cussing, but that's a preference thing. To some, this added realism and would still give it a 10, which is fine. Either way, I loved this movie and more movies should be made like it!"

      "review": "Everyone of Tarantino's films are masterpieces and this is no exception. Despite its long run time the film is filled with different sub plots that fit together perfectly and bring many laughs throughout. During the climax, tensions at an all time high leaving me at the edge of my seat, until the ending, which was such a huge twist to anyone who knows the true story. All fairytails have a happy ending, and this ones is just violent and funny at the same time."

IN HOLLYWOOD headlines two biggest current Hollywood matinee stars for their first collaboration, DiCaprio plays a washed-up actor Rick Dalton and Pitt is his former stunt double and current chauffeur, Cliff Booth, in the twilight of Hollywood's Golden Age and the year is 1969, also notoriously for the Manson Family murder of Sharon Tate (1943-69), Roman Polanski's pregnant wife, and her friends.By drawing on his facility of slasher to tackle the real-life grisly tragedy, Tarantino cunningly promises his votaries a bloodbath that prowls like the elephant in the room with its looming premonition (not least the final countdown of that ghastly night), which is unexpectedly deflected into a brutal house invasion where the preordained positions of victims and victimizers are ingeniously swapped, and comes off far...continue reading my review on my blog: cinema omnivore"

      "title": " Tarantino's love letter to Los Angeles - And Sharon Tate",
      "review": "Well where to start. This was surely something very different and in many ways very un-Tarantino, which is not a bad Thing as I liked that he gave this film a different Approach. It was also my most anticipated film of the year so of Course my expectations where extremly high wih it, especially since I am quite familiar with the Manson Murders myself. What is this movie? It is not a Biopic. This is the first Thing audiences have to understand before seeing it. It is a true love letter from Quentin Tarantino to Los Angeles and the \"good\" old days of Hollywood. And it is a personal love letter to Sharon Tate. Audiences and criticized it for the lack of a narrative plot it has. And they are Right, the film doesnt really. In fact there are many Scenes that could have been shortened or even cut when we just look at the narrative but it was not Tarantino's Intention to make a plot-based film. It is his Memory-piece. His \"Roma\" so to say. He emphasized on the characters rather than plot and Boy he did! Both leading characters Cliff Booth and Rick Dalton are extremly exciting and you Keep Looking Forward to see what this dynamic due is doing next. It of Course helps that the Performances of Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt are undoubtly Career-best turns and absolutely Award worthy in every regard. Especially Pitt soaked his role up as he never did before. You Keep forgetting it is Brad Pitt you are watching on screen. And DiCaprio's greatest Moments is when he is playing his different characters. Exceptional Performances in any way. Margot Robbie perfectly interpreted Sharon Tate. No, she doesn't say a lot in the film. But the way she adapts the character in such lovely Details brought Tate back to life for at least a few Hours and it was such an angelic-performance by Tate to really nail the Person Tate was. The rest of the appearances are rather small.... many characters come and go when they pass the paths of our three leading characters. The most noteable of those small roles / cameos are for sure Bruce Dern who was extremly hilarious and Margaret Qualley who embodied the perfect \"Manson Girl\". Not to Forget the great turn of Young actress Julia Butters and also Mike Moh and Damien Leweis deserve a shout Outs for their very small roles. Al Pacino perfectly fits his role as well and it was intersting to see Dakota Fanning in a role like that. Another thrilling aspect of the film is the cinematography. Pitch perfect Images and camera ankles. Also the way Los Angeles is portrayed in dawn or night are among the most atmospheric imageries I have seen in a Long time on screen. The Soundtrack is absolutely Fitting the atmosphere and was well Chosen for that period, too. Great editing and writing, too. And then that ending came..... oh Boy that ending. Well, see it yourself. Don't expect a film with a clear plot line but expect a real journey in time back to 1969."

      "review": "This movie is great! I watched it twice in cinemas and I loved it. For those who aren't very interested in movie history might get a bit bored in the first 2/3 of the film. But for people (like me) who just enjoy the technique behind the \"older\" movies will enjoy the first 2/3 of it the most. The last third was hilarious. Me and the whole crowd laughed so hard...thanks Tarintino for this masterpiece. Also a incredible acting by DiCaprio and Pitt. I also liked all other actors. Alpacino, Margot Robbie...oh I love her😍 So yeah you should definitely watch Once upon a time in Hollywood."

      "title": " Nostalgic Yet Fresh",
      "review": "I must admit I have not thoroughly enjoyed a Tarantino movie since Kill Bill so I approached Once Upon a Time in Hollywood with equal parts hope and hesitation. Not to say any of his movies are bad, far from it, they all have merit. It's just that I feel a lot of the modern Tarantino movies have been so over the top, polished, and indulgent that they almost become parodies of themselves. I prefer his more measured and rough around the edges freshman efforts. But my oh my, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood was an absolute delight, and despite all the pretense with which I approached it, it felt like a breath of fresh air.The movies plays out like a fictionalized historical piece about a very specific, very late 60s moment in American history. Woven in with the star-studded and morbid tale of Sharon Tate is a fading macho Hollywood front man and his almost super humanly capable stunt double. There characters are both firmly rooted in the nostalgia of the era while bringing some sense of realism by portraying the turpitude that likely would accompany the lives of people who may appear immortally cool on the big screen. Rick Dalton is deeply insecure about his acting abilities to the point of almost breaking down at the sign of his career descending, a far cry from the calm and collected presence he assumes when in character on set. His stunt double Cliff lives in a rundown trailer, probably killed his wife, and his combative personality has prevented him from achieving and true success. We like these characters but their flaws are out there for all to see and it paints them apart from the traditionally Hollywood protagonist but not to the point of become a more played out anti-hero archetype.It also is no accident that they always seem to be driving against the arrows on the road, coughing while chain smoking, and drinking excessively to the point where their livers must look worse than their hangovers feel. They are physical embodiments of the era of fame and excess, but additionally they act as audience inserts into the real and horrifying story of Sharon Tate, which Tarantino weaves into the background with a great performance of innocent Hollywood love and kindness from Robbie. Perhaps most impressively is the fact that the story of Rick Dalton and Sharon Tate intertwine so seamlessly and despite its almost three hour runtime the movie never real drags or speeds to its conclusion. The construction is not as unique as some of his other works but it manages to feel fresh for a director so established, which really did impress me.So we have this movie made about this nostalgic yet dangerous time in Californian history in the actual style of a nostalgic and warm movie from that era. It's a 60s Hollywood movie about Hollywood from the perspective of a fan living in 2019 if you will. It feels like an all too familiar dreamland, on the edge of parody, and as such it achieves some truly humorous moments with a little biting social commentary sprinkled in. And in old Hollywood fashion by the end of the film the heroes are heroes and the heavies are the heavies. Absent violence it is not, but it does not indulge to the fanatical excesses of his previous work. It is markedly mature. I anticipated a far more gory and dark ending, a possible condemnation of the romanticized Hollywood of the past, but it ended far more subtly (and in my opinion properly). The final scene had me on the edge of my seat and then in stitches and was probably my favorite in the whole film.DiCaprio and Pitt are just perfectly cast. I cannot think of a single criticism of there work here. In particular the scenes where DiCaprio plays Dalton playing a villain on the set of a western impressed me greatly. Not that he needs validation from me but he is a real talent. I am also not sure how anyone could doubt the ability of Robbie at this point in her career, here she gives a life to the role of Sharon Tate that was sorely needed. It added gravity and a sense of stakes to the ending sequence. And what can I say about Pitt, he oozes cool to the point where you actually believe he could kick Bruce Lee's ass.With Once Upon a Time in Hollywood Tarantino has solidified his already towering mark on modern film, while at the same time sending a love letter to the Hollywood of yesteryear, the town that has given him so much. Like Tate in the theater watching her own movie, you can feel the joy and love he gets from working on his craft, and that passion has garnered his movies rightful praise. I love Los Angeles, I love the movies, and I love this one in particular, it's far from flawless but in my eyes it is a 10/10."

      "review": "Once upon a tome in Hollywood is one of the longest, slowest movies I've ever seen. It didn't feel like a Tarantino movie until the last fifteen minutes. I was nodding off it was so slow. Half the movie was people driving with no dialogue. It had all the pieces but just fell flat. Pitt and DiCaprio did great with what they had but it feels like The Emperors New Clothes. No one wants to say it sucks because of who made it and who's in it. There were a few great scenes that then came to a screeching halt to more nothing. The couple next to us actually got up and left halfway through."
