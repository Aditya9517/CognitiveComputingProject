I'm sorry to say, this movie is just bad. The only way it can be good is if someone tells me the entire point was to see the trailer, go to the movies and feel like you were hustled when u got out.It looks as if the director just finished school and wanted to use every movie style she possibly could in just one flick, but with out any connection to anything what so ever. Is it a drama ? I didn't get it, at all.
