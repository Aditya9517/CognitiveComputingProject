I'm sorry to say, this movie is just bad. The only way it can be good is if someone tells me the entire point was to see the trailer, go to the movies and feel like you were hustled when u got out.It looks as if the director just finished school and wanted to use every movie style she possibly could in just one flick, but with out any connection to anything what so ever. Or maybe she just watched Netflix and thought she could do the \" is it a comedy ? Is it a drama ? Nobody knows \" but, very very poorly (unlike Netflix).I am in-love with JLo and she was actually good in this but even she, could not save this poorly made film.The characters are not relatable at all, at all ! The storyline and most of the dialogue are so boring, it's as if they just filmed a boring conversation through most of it, very lazy. The soundtrack moves between Buffy the vampire slayer moms death scene To Saturday Night live, To a cheesy 90's comedy, this makes no since what so ever and if the sound editors / director knew what they were doing, it could.To summarize:This movie was like a really bad dish made out of the best possible ingredients. I didn't get it, at all.
