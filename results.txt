 Became totally immersed in that era. So well done. Spoilers. Opinions. Observations. Reflections.Nice costuming. Pip, pip. Truly well done! She always steals the show. None of that. Please. For all the doubters and nay-sayers out there. The costumes were really beautiful. Beautifully done as always. Stunning visuals all over! A big 10 from me! especially on the costuming. Very enjoyable! What an amazing movie!!! Couldn't be happier! Cried 6 times. The surprises unexpected. The staff serving at table. The King and the Queen. Went with a group last night. They picked up right where they left off. Everyone is back! Oh, my. They were just perfect. Fantastic acting and cinematography. Cannot recommend highly enough. Disappointing and quite frankly forgettable!
