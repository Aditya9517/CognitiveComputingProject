      "review": "As I child in the 1970's I was always fascinated with the idea of human cloning. So, this film was right up my alley. Creating human clones to fight our Wars would be a great concept. As stated in the film no longer will soldiers come home with PTSD, lost limbs, or even death. A couple scenes sets in the movie reminded me of Game of Thrones. In particular the scene when Henry and Junior were in area with the skulls on the wall. At the end of the movie I read David Benioff listed as the Screenplay Writer. There has been plenty of reviews saying that the CGI is bad. It was okay for me. I saw the movie at a MJR Digital Cinema. Now my local AMC Theatre was showing Gemini Man in 3D + In HFR as well as Imax and third in Digital Format. I am not a fan of 3D movie due to the fact I get bad headaches and sometime pain in my eyes from watching movies in 3D."

      "review": "I can't believe what terrible reviews this movie got. For a concept so big yet so unique, it would be very hard to execute it rightly. And when I saw the poor reviews for this movie, I lost high hopes, thinking it failed to do it right. But they were wrong. This movie is a groundbreaking peice of art. The cgi in it is unlike anything I've ever seen. And as the movie progresses, the characters move closer and closer to me. Clay Junior feels like an accurate depiction of someone who finds out he's a clone of someone who knows more about him than he does, and Henry Brogan is such a great character as well. I personally can barely think of anything bad about this movie that deserves it's hate. And I highly recommend it to you."

      "review": "Heralded as a new technological advancement for filmmaking thanks to its shooting in 4K, 3D and 120FPS and its de-aging effects works on its leading man Will Smith, Academy Award winning director Ang Lee's newest Hollywood film Gemini Man may be technically intriguing but that's where the buck stops with a film that had no chance of overcoming any of its narrative or delivery failures in what's a dull, badly written and downright dumb sci-fi thriller that will likely go down as one of 2019's greatest box office duds.Hovering around Hollywood in various forms since the 90's, with the likes of Nicolas Cage attached to star and Tony Scott and Curtis Hanson in talks to direct, Gemini Man quite clearly had some issues it needed to overcome before seeing the light of day, meaning it's quite sad that Lee, wonder producer Jerry Bruckheimer and the films writers David Benioff, Billy Ray and Darren Lemke didn't manage to overcome them in what is a final product that is barely deserving of public consumption, let alone a big cinematic release.With only a handful of cinemas around the world even capable of showcasing Gemini Man in its true format, there's wonder the much talked about wizardry of the film matters at all as when you strip this film back to the form and manner in which many (including myself) had and will see it, all that's left is a badly constructed sci-fi thriller that gives leading man Will Smith and his tired looking co-stars a plethora of bad dialogue and a bunch of generic characters that offer nothing to a story that doesn't even feel at all original or noteworthy.Everything in Lee's film feels stale and devoid of spark, there's some nice but fairly forgettable action sequences to be found, highlights of which is a motorbike chase that eventuates into a laughably bad CGI fest as two Will Smith's battle it out and start using their bikes as missiles but overall everything in Lee's film feels peculiar and unnatural, never more so evident than creepy young CGI Will Smith.In what's supposed to be the films big selling point as a spectacle, two Will Smith's for the price of one, the younger version of Smith's super-hitman Henry Brogan known as Junior is a creation that you can never warm to and despite the sprinkling's of moments that Junior comes off as a realistic creation, there are far too many occurrences where the films CGI wizardry on Junior takes you right out of the moment, more likely to induce laughter rather than awe-inspiring reactions.It's sad to see Smith continue to struggle in lead roles as he does here, a problem that has been more frequent than ever the last decade and while his not so much outright bad, he fails to get Gemini Man into any extra gear while Lee continues to be a baffling player behind the camera with his films genuine pot luck propositions as he struggles to reach the highs of his early to mid-2000's outputs.Another hugely detrimental aspect to Gemini Man's enjoyment levels is that once we become aware of what a cloned Brogan means and the reasoning behind why this dastardly creation exists, you wonder why we should be against it, making the whole point of Brogan's mission rather pointless as we end up curiously siding with Clive Owen's hammy \"bad guy\" Clay Verris who really truly does kind of have a point.Final Say -With all his focus on the technical that doesn't even end up being all that amazing, Lee has forgot to make a good film in the meantime. A film that is equal amounts dumb, bland and uninspired, Gemini Man is the very worst kind of Hollywood blockbuster that is more likely to encourage sleep rather than encourage viewers to have a fun time with an enjoyable piece of escapist entertainment.1 ½ perfectly placed piece of product placement out of 5"

When the first scene started in the theatre I became aware of the b -movie style of making, but still tought, ok it´s nothing bad, could be a kind of european tv action movie french style. Oh boy how wrong I was about that. This movie is a kind of chinese made f-movie with stupid camera ancles and bad storie telling. After all this movie is very dissapointing,compared to the very promising trailer."

      "review": "Seen before, done many times, there isn't much new with \"Gemini Man\" except it's gimmick feature of cloning.That being said, it's not bad, it's just simple. The story is basic and has been similar to the plot of many other action films that involve government security. Although they play it safe it does excite, it does draw you in, and it is enjoyable. What counts most in movies like this, that try to get you asking questions, is the ending. When you think of the plot and soak in what just happened, you cannot help but think \"oh, it's a less complicated Bourne movie.\"Acting from its lead, Will Smith, is great and he is in incredible shape. He is undoubtedly committed and truly becomes the character that's been written for him. He is impressive when acting out his clone, however the CGI is hard to watch. For the most part it works, but some scenes focus too much on his face, forcing the viewer to dwell on the fakeness of the CGI. The supporting cast are also quite good, although a little shallow with them not being fleshed out as well as they could have been. This isn't because of their acting ability, but because the writing was simple.At the end of the day, what takes away from this film is it's writing. It could have explored the moral choices and consequences of cloning a little more but all we get is a little conversation at the end with no real outcome. If not that, it could have made the plot of government conspiracy a little more complex and heavy.Good acting. Fun time. Uncomplicated."

      "review": "First of all, I want to make it clear that this film should have 2 separate score system.The first one is the common system, which you score the movie for its plot, and screenwrites, and etc. And that score is just about average.But this film is revolutionary in a completely different way. As it is filmed at 120FPS, and in 4K, meaning only a handful of cinemas around the world is able to show its absolutely stunning visual spectacle.The words can't describe it, you only have to see it to know it, and it is nothing like I've ever seen in a cinema. Albeit it has flaws, it gave me a whole new idea of how well the modern technology can capture the real life image, and all those brilliant IMAX films I've seen in the past were nowhere near the visual reality that this film is able to capture. For the same reason \"The Arrival of a Train\" is highly regarded, I give Gemini Man a 10.I wish there will be more Cinity films in the future, so that more people will be able to see it, and also, I wish they fix that motion dizziness issues for some people."

This \"anti-aging\" technology was done before and I consider it a bold choice to have it made into a full length feature film. It amazed me when i saw it on the small screen (12 monkeys, etc).That reason alone should earn points. Cinematography, shooting locations, color schemes all were great. And to boot, i havent enjoyed Will smith in a role this much since the old days. Also the stellar Supporting cast was great.Would this have been better as a 6 episode series? Probably. But when something semi-fresh comes to us for OUR entertainment, it should be embraces. Knocking movies like this will just keep them fewer and further.I enjoyed it, as did most others i watched it with. Give it a go and form your own opinion."

Wow!The people that are rating this low are of the same people who thought Tarantino'a latest film 'Once upon a Time in Hollywood' was 9.5 worthy, and don't even get me started on the boring of a film that literally consisted of us watching a guy drive around town.Yes the script could be deeper, and I personally think this movie could have been a nice mini series where things were explained more, but taking it at face value for what it is, an action flick, it's really great. Again; do not listen to the reviews from people who thought Tarantino's latest film that droned on about the old days of Hollywood, was somehow a good film lmao."

I did enjoy seeing Will Smith in another movie and there were certain aspects of the film that were entertaining.Unfortunately, I struggled with the piss poor CGI rendering of Will Smith's younger self. So much so that I found it difficult to enjoy the movie. It just seemed silly. Also, I'm not quite sure I would rate the writing as bad as some of the other people here have but it is true that it lacks depth. Also, some aspects of it were highly predictable. Perhaps written for people who Get easily confused. No idea.You want to love the characters, but the way it is written and directed its hard to really grow an attachment to them. The characters felt emotionally shallow. I found it difficult to really care what happens to them."

      "review": "Gemini ManLee's cartoonish speech is similar to Tim Burton's. Although it doesn't mean that it weighs the director, Ang Lee down, like it does to him. This has always been the major difference between their direction. If Burton invests incredibly on his set pieces, the production design, that is to say he is ready for creating this world, childish and loveable. Ang Lee on the other hand, sits back and waits for the post-production time, his favorite slot, where he colors his world with eye popping visual aesthetics that comes in handy in our CGI generation.There is nothing wrong with both of their methods. If anything I'd call it a bold move. For the risk is higher now, the stakes are doubled. Now, there is this sword hanging by a hair on your head whispering you the inconvenient- and yes, inconvenient- consequence of your misfire. So what happens if you somehow land the landing with a dramatic pose in this minefield. Well, the answer is Life Of Pi. And what happens if you fail? Unfortunately the answer is Gemini Man.And I have to soldier on in my life thinking that this film is bad. Especially, the work that was involved. And I am not going to go and rant about the visual effects but for Will Smith. That is not to say, his performance is some captivating soul that latches onto you from the start. If anything it is actually dull. But then there are these glimpses that he shares with us that are truly pure. This may also suggest that the film is edited poorly. It is not the first time that a good performance was edited out into a bad one. It is just that I didn't want this one to be stated under that sad list."

The actions are decent, sometimes felt like in a game, maybe due to the technology? Some dialog is interesting, the acting is mostly fine. I only have one problem: Would a top assassin usually be iron-heart? Will Smith seemed to show too much emotion and sensation.The receipt has been used so many times before and it is surprising to see there is no new twist added."

      "title": " Sadly, a Misfire that Visually Looks Great",
      "review": "I will always admire films that take chances or try to push the boundaries of cinema. Whether or not you enjoyed Avatar or not, it's without question that it was an exceptional achievement, visually. More recently, movies like Gravity or Life of Pi have also pushed the boundaries of the technical side of filmmaking and both accomplished wonders. Director Ang Lee, who also directed Life of Pi, is at the helm here for Gemini Man, and while it may look fantastic in terms of cinematography, this movie is a misfire. Here's why I believe Gemini Man isn't worth your time.Following a hitman in Henry Brogan (Will Smith) as he's on the verge of retirement, this film kicks into gear when he discovers that a younger version of himself was cloned and sent to kill him. That's pretty much the premise of the movie, so if you were hoping to dive deeper than that, then you're going to be disappointed. Honestly, if you've seen the trailer for this movie, you've seen all the major story beats it hits. Gemini Man does nothing to wow or surprises its audience, which is a surprise in itself, given the director at hand.From Brokeback Mountain to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Ang Lee has directed a few of the most celebrated movies over the last 20 years. I haven't seen the majority of his filmography, but of the films I have seen, this is easily his weakest effort yet. Not to say he wasn't trying, because the effort is clearly on display, but it just doesn't work overall. The most notable aspect of this movie is the cinematography by Dion Beebe. This man has been in the business for over 27 years and his talents have yet to waiver. From the very opening shot, my eyes were glued to the screen. Sadly, the pacing and overall story ended up taking away from this, and not very subtly either.Now for the most distracting and frustrating portion of the movie. The premise and the way it's executed are already off-putting enough, but the big selling point about this film is the fact that Will Smith gives two separate performances, both as himself and a younger version. He actually gives a far better performance than this film deserves, but even I (who is usually fairly forgiving about things like this) have to admit that the facial work on his younger version stood out like a sore thumb. Even down to the hand-to-hand combat scenes. It was clear that the person he was fighting had CGI work done to him. This idea is neat in concept, but it really didn't work here.In the end, Gemini Man surely started as a concept that had director Ang Lee very eager to bring to life, and although his vision and Beebe's framing truly do stand out as positives, this is a film that had too many conflicted writers working on it, and it shows big time. Smith puts his all into this performance and his back and forth with Mary Elizabeth Winstead was even nice at times, but this movie extraordinarily suffers from a bad screenplay and distracting visuals. I really wanted to like this movie and even chose to ignore the audience and critic reactions, but I'm with the majority on this one. It's quite a bad film as a final product."

I don't understand what the plot was at all and everything seemed made up and improvised as it went. Didn't buy the lead actress either and why did Clive Owen have such a weird role. Like again did the writers make up these characters in a day? When I woke up at the end the whole \"reveal\" of the second clone was too convenient if you ask me and a forgettable scene."

      "review": "I thought this was going to be a slow dragged on film but it wasn't the film just went on i thought it was slow like 10 or 15 minutes but then it moves on itself to quicker pacing. this movie was going to be make long time directed by tony scott in 1997 and cast was soo big to star like Sylvester Stallone i wouldn't mind to see that to see RAMBO VS RAMBO, Arnold was going to be cast as welli wouldn't mind to see that as well like Terminator vs Terminator i wouldn't mind to see sly and Arnold in this type of movie, witch Arnold did a type of movie like this 6th day come out in 2000, Clint Eastwood was going to be attached as well i wouldn't mind to see Harry Callahan vs Harry Callahan seeing each another saying go ahead make my day that would been sick then rest of cast is Nicholas cage, Jon Voight, Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise, Chris O'Donnellis eh bad choice i rather another's then him, Harrison Ford eh i reckon he will be okay for role, Mel Gibson more like mad max vs mad max or Martin Riggs vs Martin Riggs, then Sean Connery more like 007 vs 007 witch is sick. The film never progressed at Disney, though, as the technology was not developed enough at that time for the film to be produced witch is sad but how in earth 6th day film with Arnold got that technology to make his character like clone witch i thought to myself they made this movie back in 2000's like 6th day did. but anyway now since past this film got made starting will smith as lead role witch i like will smith as actor Bad boys 1&2 films, Independence day, enemy of state, Ali, I, Robot, Hitch, I Am Legend, Hancock, Suicide Squad, Bright now tothis film witch i did enjoy and seeing this in 3D wasn't bad experience but 3D isn't that special, to this film it's pretty enjoyable the story and script was good, Clive Owen was good in this film as well as villain. i thought Ang lee is good director but i wanted to see Ridley scott to direct this movie someone but if tony scott was alive i recokin it would been a much better who know's how he is going to write this movie. But the real star of the film is the 3d extra high frame rate of 120fps. Unfortunately it gives the film a documentary-style look witch it looks odd because i wanted cinematography to be like actually movie but i have no clue why Ang Lee made it look like documenty but still well shot film. i was glad to ignore reviews because reviews most of times 10 out 10 times wrong for films because i avoid joker never seen it but i wanted to put my money in this movie i thought this looked like more movie for me to see rather then seeing joker. every time i judge movie i judge it myself whatever i like movie or not but i ended liking this until this day i don't understand how reviews hate this film ? Watch it before reading the critics if you do you will end missing out this great fun popcorn will smith film witch had great action scenes, great CGI of clone smith, i never understand the low scores here if you do avoid this and thinking this is bad because of reviews go ahead because your missing out this intersing film, avoid joker start going your own way. WillSmith does it again. Awesome storyline with a lot of action and stuff blowing up! This movie offers something different then the typical Government conspiracy, and the way Will acts from the way he use to act in his Fresh Prince days to the way he acts in Movies now. This movie doesn't have a dull moment i never understand the hates. the story follows will smith (Henry Brogan) an aging government assassin regarded as the best killer of his generation he has been doing it for his all life he wants to retire as a assassin. Clay Varris (Clive Owen) witch he does good script he has been given is good he request's aGemini man he is a head of a top-secret black ops unit codenamed \"GEMINI\", wants to go after Henry but is denied the request. because he wants a younger clone because when people's in their 20's they do mistakes they listen to older people, so he wants a younger clone so he can have his own assassin and kill older Henry. (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) Dani Zakarweski, a hitwoman and ally of Henry who remains loyal to him after he is targeted for death, she helps him and follows him to get to clone. another character Baron (Benedict Wong) who is a colleague of Henry and Dani. action scenes with will smith and clone version of him had a fight scene but i wish their could been much better like have more of showdown together a lot more fight scene together, action scenes are well done can't say much of it nothing to companying about.rest of movie is really good end of day you like it but it's not best film ever but i thought this is really underrated film people wanna worser movie then this watch After Earth (2013) that is much, much worser movie then to this movie much worse specially his son jarden smith worser actor ever to be in this movie ever this is kinda movie that is watchable not a mediocre i call it but it's enjoyable and watchable film it's bad film as what you think it is from reviews give it a look, give this a try save joker or any another movies is theater give this a shot it's worth it 8.10 i am waiting for Bad Boys III aka Bad boys for life."

      "review": "Me and my girlfriend had a blast. The 3D effect went a long way to enhance the experience to the point of VR level. You just feel like you're there. That ups the stakes of every situation, no matter how seen before it is. So from beautiful vistas of Budapest to accelerating motorbike chases to 1st person POV firefights and accompanying sound effects, this flick is a winner in my book."

      "review": "Look, movies are for entertainment. Period. I don't spend my money to go pick apart special effects or scripts etc. I enjoyed the movie and will recommend it to friends and family. I'm a Will Smith fan and found his dual portrayal fun and nuanced. The young clone was innocent and naive compared to the world weary \"original\" who hated the ghosts he believed haunted him. Worth seeing!"
